For data scientists, these biases can really change the way we work with data and make our day-to-day decisions, and generally not for the better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stop Worrying and Create your Deep Learning Server in 30 minutes</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/05/25/dls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/05/25/dls/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have found myself creating a Deep Learning Machine time and time again whenever I start a new project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How and Why to use f strings in Python3?</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/05/24/fstring/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/05/24/fstring/</guid><description>&lt;p>

The data which may be messy, unwieldy and big. So here are the list of algorithms that helps a data scientist to make better models using the data they have:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things to see while buying a Mutual Fund</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2016/12/24/mutual_fund_ratios/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2016/12/24/mutual_fund_ratios/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a post which deviates from my pattern fo blogs that I have wrote till now but I found that Finance also uses up a lot of Statistics. So it won&amp;rsquo;t be a far cry to put this on my blog here. I recently started investing in Mutual funds so thought of rersearching the area before going all in.

(Quite a Braggard I know)
So thought about adding a post about Pandas usage here. I intend to make this post quite practical and since I find the pandas syntax quite self explanatory, I won&amp;rsquo;t be explaining much of the codes. Just the use cases and the code to achieve them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying ML Apps using Python and Flask- Learning about Flask</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2016/01/10/deploying_ml_apps_using_python_flask/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2016/01/10/deploying_ml_apps_using_python_flask/</guid><description>&lt;p>It has been a long time since I wrote anything on my blog.

It lets you do stuff on the command line which you never imagined. As a matter of fact, it&amp;rsquo;s a whole data analytics software in itself when you think about it. You can do selections, groupby, mean, median, sum, duplication, append. You just ask. There is no limit actually.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shell Basics every Data Scientist Should know -Part I</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2015/10/09/shell_basics_for_data_science/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2015/10/09/shell_basics_for_data_science/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shell Commands are powerful.

It has made my life easier in a sense that I am able to get results which I was not able to see with SQL queries. But still I find it painfully slow.
I have to write procedural programs while I work. As in merge these two datasets and then filter and then merge another dataset and then filter using some condition and yada-yada.
You get the gist. And in hadoop its painstakingly boring to do this. You have to write more than maybe 3 Mapreduce Jobs. One job will read the data line by line and write to the disk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Behold the power of MCMC</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2015/08/21/mcmc_algorithm_cryptography/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2015/08/21/mcmc_algorithm_cryptography/</guid><description>&lt;div style="margin-top: 9px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
