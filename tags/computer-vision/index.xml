&lt;p>Recently I started up with a competition on kaggle on text classification, and as a part of the competition, I had to somehow move to Pytorch to get deterministic results. Now I have always worked with Keras in the past and it has given me pretty good results, but somehow I got to know that the &lt;strong>CuDNNGRU/CuDNNLSTM layers in keras are not deterministic&lt;/strong>, even after setting the seeds. So Pytorch did come to rescue. And am I glad that I moved.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Object Detection: An End to End Theoretical Perspective</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2018/09/22/object_detection/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2018/09/22/object_detection/</guid><description>&lt;p>We all know about the image classification problem.
