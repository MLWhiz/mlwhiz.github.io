&lt;p>Reading code is a hard skill to inculcate. I just realized this just recently when I had to look at every sort of code be it C+ +, PHP, Java or Python. And I was really amazed how people around me were able to navigate such vast and diverse code bases. Did they really understand all these programming languages? Everyone around me was giving me code pointers as to where to look and where to change code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Set Environment Variables in Linux?</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2022/11/27/env_vars/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2022/11/27/env_vars/</guid><description>&lt;hr>

And that’s mainly because it is not really explained in the right way in a lot of places. Normally a lot of books start by explaining OOP by talking about the three big terms — &lt;strong>Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism&lt;/strong>. But the time the book can explain these topics, anyone who is just starting would already feel lost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding Transformers, the Programming Way</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/10/10/create-transformer-from-scratch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/10/10/create-transformer-from-scratch/</guid><description>&lt;p>Transformers have become the defacto standard for NLP tasks nowadays.
