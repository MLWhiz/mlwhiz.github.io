      <description>Graphs provide us with a very useful data structure. They can help us to find structure within our data. With the advent of Machine learning and big data we need to get as much information as possible about our data. Learning a little bit of graph theory can certainly help us with that.
Here is a Graph Analytics for Big Data course on Coursera by UCSanDiego which I highly recommend to learn the basics of graph theory.</description>
