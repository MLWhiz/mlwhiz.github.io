      <description>Deeplearning is the buzz word right now. I was working on the course for deep learning by Jeremy Howard and one thing I noticed were pretrained deep Neural Networks. In the first lesson he used the pretrained NN to predict on the Dogs vs Cats competition on Kaggle to achieve very good results.
What are pretrained Neural Networks? So let me tell you about the background a little bit. There is a challenge that happens every year in the visual recognition community - The Imagenet Challenge.</description>
