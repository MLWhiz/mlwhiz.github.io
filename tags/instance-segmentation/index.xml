) on instance segmentation. And, I really wanted to have something like the Iris Dataset for Instance Segmentation so that I would be able to explain the model without worrying about the dataset too much. But, alas, it is not always possible to get a dataset that you are looking for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Implementing Object Detection and Instance Segmentation for Data Scientists</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/12/06/weapons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/12/06/weapons/</guid><description>&lt;p>Object Detection is a helpful tool to have in your coding repository.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Demystifying Object Detection and Instance Segmentation for Data Scientists</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/12/05/od/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/12/05/od/</guid><description>&lt;p>I like deep learning a lot but Object Detection is something that doesn’t come easily to me.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
