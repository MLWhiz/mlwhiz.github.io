Unfortunately, many data scientists often just end up seeing the ROC curves and then quoting an AUC (short for the area under the ROC curve) value without really understanding what the AUC value means and how they can use them more effectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Most Complete Guide to pySpark DataFrames</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/06/06/spark_df_complete_guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/06/06/spark_df_complete_guide/</guid><description>&lt;p>Big Data has become synonymous with Data engineering.

I coming from a non-statistic background am not so well versed in these and keep forgetting about the properties of these famous distributions. That is why I chose to write my own understanding in an intuitive way to keep a track.
One of the most helpful way to learn more about these is the
