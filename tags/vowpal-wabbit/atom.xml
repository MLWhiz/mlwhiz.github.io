      <description>In online advertising, click-through rate (CTR) is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. As a result, click prediction systems are essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding.
For this competition, we have provided 11 days worth of Avazu data to build and test prediction models. Can you find a strategy that beats standard classification algorithms? The winning models from this competition will be released under an open-source license.</description>
