        <![CDATA[    I love Jupyter notebooks and the power they provide.
They can be used to present findings as well as share code in the most effective manner which was not easy with the previous IDEs.
Yet there is something still amiss.
There are a few functionalities I aspire in my text editor which don’t come by default in Jupyter.
But fret not. Just like everything in Python, Jupyter too has third-party extensions.
This post is about some of the most useful extensions I found.
1. Collapsible Headings The one extension, I like most is collapsible headings.
It makes the flow of the notebook easier to comprehend and also helps in creating presentable notebooks.
To get this one, install the jupyter_contrib_nbextensions package with this command on the terminal window:
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions  Once the package is installed, we can start jupyter notebook using:
jupyter notebook  Once you go to the home page of your jupyter notebook, you can see that a new tab for NBExtensions is created.
  And we can get a lot of extensions using this package.
  This is how it looks:
  2. Automatic Imports   Automation is the future.
One thing that bugs me is that whenever I open a new Jupyter notebook in any of my data science projects, I need to copy paste a lot of libraries and default options for some of them.
To tell you about some of the usual imports I use:
 Pandas and numpy — In my view, Python must make these two as a default import.
 Seaborn, matplotlib, plotly_express
 change some pandas and seaborn default options.
  Here is the script that I end up pasting over and over again.
import pandas as pd import numpy as np import plotly_express as px import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline *# We dont Probably need the Gridlines. Do we? If yes comment this line* sns.set(style=&amp;#34;ticks&amp;#34;) # pandas defaults pd.options.display.max_columns = 500 pd.options.display.max_rows = 500 Is there a way I can automate this?
Just go to the nbextensions tab and select the snippets extension.
You will need to make the following changes to the snippets.json file. You can find this file at /miniconda3/envs/py36/share/jupyter/nbextensions/snippets location. The py36 in this location here is my conda virtualenv. It took me some time to find this location for me. Yours might be different. Please note that you don’t have to change at the site-packages location.
{ &amp;#34;snippets&amp;#34; : [ { &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; : &amp;#34;example&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;code&amp;#34; : [ &amp;#34;# This is an example snippet!&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;# To create your own, add a new snippet block to the&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;# snippets.json file in your jupyter nbextensions directory:&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;# /nbextensions/snippets/snippets.json&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;import this&amp;#34; ] }, { &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; : &amp;#34;default&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;code&amp;#34; : [ &amp;#34;# This is A snippet for all data related tasks&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;import pandas as pd&amp;#34; &amp;#34;import numpy as np&amp;#34; &amp;#34;import plotly_express as px&amp;#34; &amp;#34;import seaborn as sns&amp;#34; &amp;#34;import matplotlib.pyplot as plt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;%matplotlib inline&amp;#34; &amp;#34;# We dont Probably need the Gridlines. Do we? If yes comment this line&amp;#34; &amp;#34;sns.set(style=&amp;#39;ticks&amp;#39;)&amp;#34; &amp;#34;# pandas defaults&amp;#34; &amp;#34;pd.options.display.max_columns = 500&amp;#34; &amp;#34;pd.options.display.max_rows = 500&amp;#34; ] } ] } You can see this extension in action below.
  Pretty cool. Right? I also use this to create basic snippets for my deep learning notebooks and NLP based notebooks.
3. Execution Time We have used %time as well as decorator based timer functions to measure time for our functions. You can also use this excellent extension to do that.
Plus it looks great.
Just select the ExecutionTime extension from the NBextensions list and you will have an execution result at the bottom of the cell after every cell execution as well as the time when the cell was executed.
  Other Extensions   NBExtensions has a lot of extensions. Some other extensions from NBExtensions I like and you might want to look at:
 Limit Output: Ever had your notebook hang since you printed a lot of text in your notebook. This extension limits the number of characters that can be printed below a code cell
 2to3Convertor: Having problems with your old python2 notebooks. Tired of changing the print statements. This one is a good one.
     Live Markdown Preview: Some of us like writing our blogs using Markdown in a jupyter notebook. Sometimes it can be hectic as you make errors in writing. Now you can see Live-preview of the rendered output of markdown cells while editing their source.    Conclusion I love how there is a package for everything with Python. And that holds good with the Jupyter notebook too.
The jupyter_contrib_nbextensions package works great out of the box.
It has made my life a lot easier when it comes to checking execution times, scrolling through the notebook, and repetitive tasks.
There are many other extensions this package does provide. Do take a look at them and try to see which ones you find useful.
Also, if you want to learn more about Python 3, I would like to call out an excellent course on Learn Intermediate level Python from the University of Michigan. Do check it out.
I am going to be writing more of such posts in the future too. Let me know what you think about the series. Follow me up at Medium or Subscribe to my blog to be informed about them. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism and can be reached on Twitter @mlwhiz.

        <![CDATA[    I bet most of us have seen a lot of AI-generated people faces in recent times, be it in papers or blogs. We have reached a stage where it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between actual human faces and faces that are generated by Artificial Intelligence.
In this post, I will help the reader to understand how they can create and build such applications on their own.
I will try to keep this post as intuitive as possible for starters while not dumbing it down too much.
This post is about understanding how GANs work.
Task Overview I will work on creating our own anime characters using anime characters dataset.
The DC-GAN flavor of GANs which I will use here is widely applicable not only to generate Faces or new anime characters; it can also be used to create modern fashion styles, for general content creation and sometimes for data augmentation purposes as well.
As per my view, GANs will change the way video games and special effects are generated. The approach could create realistic textures or characters on demand.
You can find the full code for this chapter in the Github Repository. I have also uploaded the code to Google Colab so that you can try it yourself.
Using DCGAN architecture to generate anime images As always before we get into the coding, it helps to delve a little bit into the theory.
The main idea of DC-GAN’s stemmed from the paper UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS written in 2016 by Alec Radford, Luke Metz, and Soumith Chintala.
Although I am going to explain the paper in the next few sections, do take a look at it. It is an excellent paper.
INTUITION: Brief Intro to GANs for Generating Fake Images   Generator vs. Discriminator    Typically, GANs employ two dueling neural networks to train a computer to learn the nature of a data set well enough to generate convincing fakes.
We can think of this as two systems where one Neural Network works to generate fakes (Generator), and another neural network (Discriminator) tries to classify which image is a fake.
As both generator and discriminator networks do this repetitively, the networks eventually get better at their respective tasks.
Think of this as simple as swordplay. Two noobs start sparring with each other. After a while, both become better at swordplay.
Or you could think of this as a robber(generator) and a policeman(Discriminator). After a lot of thefts, the robber becomes better at thieving while the policeman gets better at catching the robber. In an ideal world.
The Losses in these neural networks are primarily a function of how the other network performs:
 Discriminator network loss is a function of generator network quality- Loss is high for the discriminator if it gets fooled by the generator’s fake images
 Generator network loss is a function of discriminator network quality — Loss is high if the generator is not able to fool the discriminator.
  In the training phase, we train our Discriminator and Generator networks sequentially intending to improve both the Discriminator and Generator performance.
The objective is to end up with weights that help Generators to generate realistic looking images. In the end, we can use the Generator Neural network to generate fake images from Random Noise.
Generator architecture One of the main problems we face with GANs is that the training is not very stable. Thus we have to come up with a Generator architecture that solves our problem and also results in stable training.
     The preceding diagram is taken from the paper, which explains the DC-GAN generator architecture. It might look a little bit confusing.
Essentially we can think of a generator Neural Network as a black box which takes as input a 100 sized normally generated vector of numbers and gives us an image:
     How do we get such an architecture?
In the below architecture, we use a dense layer of size 4x4x1024 to create a dense vector out of this 100-d vector. Then, we reshape this dense vector in the shape of an image of 4x4 with 1024 filters, as shown in the following figure:
  tc   We don’t have to worry about any weights right now as the network itself will learn those while training.
Once we have the 1024 4x4 maps, we do upsampling using a series of Transposed convolutions, which after each operation doubles the size of the image and halves the number of maps. In the last step, though we don’t half the number of maps but reduce it to 3 channels/maps only for each RGB channel since we need three channels for the output image.
Now, What are Transpose convolutions? In most simple terms, transpose convolutions provide us with a way to upsample images. While in the convolution operation we try to go from a 4x4 image to a 2x2 image, in Transpose convolutions, we convolve from 2x2 to 4x4 as shown in the following figure:
     Q: We know that Un-pooling is popularly used for upsampling input feature maps in the convolutional neural network (CNN). Why don’t we use Un-pooling?
It is because un-pooling does not involve any learning. However, transposed convolution is learnable, and that is why we prefer transposed convolutions to un-pooling. Their parameters can be learned by the generator as we will see in some time.
Discriminator architecture Now, as we have understood the generator architecture, here is the discriminator as a black box.
In practice, it contains a series of convolutional layers and a dense layer at the end to predict if an image is fake or not as shown in the following figure:
     Takes an image as input and predicts if it is real/fake. Every image conv net ever.
Data preprocessing and visualization The first thing we want to do is to look at some of the images in the dataset. The following are the python commands to visualize some of the images from the dataset:
filenames = glob.glob(&amp;#39;animeface-character-dataset/*/*.pn*&amp;#39;) plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8)) for i in range(5): img = plt.imread(filenames[i], 0) plt.subplot(4, 5, i&#43;1) plt.imshow(img) plt.title(img.shape) plt.xticks([]) plt.yticks([]) plt.tight_layout() plt.show() The resultant output is as follows:
     We get to see the sizes of the images and the images themselves.
We also need functions to preprocess the images to a standard size of 64x64x3, in this particular case, before proceeding further with our training.
We will also need to normalize the image pixels before we use it to train our GAN. You can see the code it is well commented.
# A function to normalize image pixels. def norm_img(img): &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;A function to Normalize Images. Input: img : Original image as numpy array. Output: Normailized Image as numpy array &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; img = (img / 127.5) - 1 return img def denorm_img(img): &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;A function to Denormailze, i.e. recreate image from normalized image Input: img : Normalized image as numpy array. Output: Original Image as numpy array &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; img = (img &#43; 1) * 127.5 return img.astype(np.uint8) def sample_from_dataset(batch_size, image_shape, data_dir=None): &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Create a batch of image samples by sampling random images from a data directory. Resizes the image using image_shape and normalize the images. Input: batch_size : Sample size required image_size : Size that Image should be resized to data_dir : Path of directory where training images are placed. Output: sample : batch of processed images &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; sample_dim = (batch_size,) &#43; image_shape sample = np.empty(sample_dim, dtype=np.float32) all_data_dirlist = list(glob.glob(data_dir)) sample_imgs_paths = np.random.choice(all_data_dirlist,batch_size) for index,img_filename in enumerate(sample_imgs_paths): image = Image.open(img_filename) image = image.resize(image_shape[:-1]) image = image.convert(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;) image = np.asarray(image) image = norm_img(image) sample[index,...] = image return sample As you will see, we will be using the preceding defined functions in the training part of our code.
Implementation of DCGAN This is the part where we define our DCGAN. We will be defining our noise generator function, Generator architecture, and Discriminator architecture.
Generating noise vector for Generator   Kids: Normal Noise generators    The following code block is a helper function to create a noise vector of predefined length for a Generator. It will generate the noise which we want to convert to an image using our generator architecture.
We use a normal distribution
to generate the noise vector:
def gen_noise(batch_size, noise_shape): &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Generates a numpy vector sampled from normal distribution of shape (batch_size,noise_shape) Input: batch_size : size of batch noise_shape: shape of noise vector, normally kept as 100 Output:a numpy vector sampled from normal distribution of shape (batch_size,noise_shape) &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; return np.random.normal(0, 1, size=(batch_size,)&#43;noise_shape) Generator architecture The Generator is the most crucial part of the GAN.
Here, I create a generator by adding some transposed convolution layers to upsample the noise vector to an image.
As you will notice, this generator architecture is not the same as given in the Original DC-GAN paper.
I needed to make some architectural changes to fit our data better, so I added a convolution layer in the middle and removed all dense layers from the generator architecture, making it fully convolutional.
I also use a lot of Batchnorm layers with a momentum of 0.5 and leaky ReLU activation. I use Adam optimizer with β=0.5. The following code block is the function I will use to create the generator:
def get_gen_normal(noise_shape): &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; This function takes as input shape of the noise vector and creates the Keras generator architecture. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; kernel_init = &amp;#39;glorot_uniform&amp;#39; gen_input = Input(shape = noise_shape) # Transpose 2D conv layer 1.  generator = Conv2DTranspose(filters = 512, kernel_size = (4,4), strides = (1,1), padding = &amp;#34;valid&amp;#34;, data_format = &amp;#34;channels_last&amp;#34;, kernel_initializer = kernel_init)(gen_input) generator = BatchNormalization(momentum = 0.5)(generator) generator = LeakyReLU(0.2)(generator) # Transpose 2D conv layer 2. generator = Conv2DTranspose(filters = 256, kernel_size = (4,4), strides = (2,2), padding = &amp;#34;same&amp;#34;, data_format = &amp;#34;channels_last&amp;#34;, kernel_initializer = kernel_init)(generator) generator = BatchNormalization(momentum = 0.5)(generator) generator = LeakyReLU(0.2)(generator) # Transpose 2D conv layer 3. generator = Conv2DTranspose(filters = 128, kernel_size = (4,4), strides = (2,2), padding = &amp;#34;same&amp;#34;, data_format = &amp;#34;channels_last&amp;#34;, kernel_initializer = kernel_init)(generator) generator = BatchNormalization(momentum = 0.5)(generator) generator = LeakyReLU(0.2)(generator) # Transpose 2D conv layer 4. generator = Conv2DTranspose(filters = 64, kernel_size = (4,4), strides = (2,2), padding = &amp;#34;same&amp;#34;, data_format = &amp;#34;channels_last&amp;#34;, kernel_initializer = kernel_init)(generator) generator = BatchNormalization(momentum = 0.5)(generator) generator = LeakyReLU(0.2)(generator) # conv 2D layer 1. generator = Conv2D(filters = 64, kernel_size = (3,3), strides = (1,1), padding = &amp;#34;same&amp;#34;, data_format = &amp;#34;channels_last&amp;#34;, kernel_initializer = kernel_init)(generator) generator = BatchNormalization(momentum = 0.5)(generator) generator = LeakyReLU(0.2)(generator) # Final Transpose 2D conv layer 5 to generate final image. Filter size 3 for 3 image channel generator = Conv2DTranspose(filters = 3, kernel_size = (4,4), strides = (2,2), padding = &amp;#34;same&amp;#34;, data_format = &amp;#34;channels_last&amp;#34;, kernel_initializer = kernel_init)(generator) # Tanh activation to get final normalized image generator = Activation(&amp;#39;tanh&amp;#39;)(generator) # defining the optimizer and compiling the generator model. gen_opt = Adam(lr=0.00015, beta_1=0.5) generator_model = Model(input = gen_input, output = generator) generator_model.compile(loss=&amp;#39;binary_crossentropy&amp;#39;, optimizer=gen_opt, metrics=[&amp;#39;accuracy&amp;#39;]) generator_model.summary() return generator_model You can plot the final generator model:
plot_model(generator, to_file=&amp;#39;gen_plot.png&amp;#39;, show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True)   Generator Architecture    Discriminator architecture Here is the discriminator architecture where I use a series of convolutional layers and a dense layer at the end to predict if an image is fake or not.
Here is the architecture of the discriminator:
def get_disc_normal(image_shape=(64,64,3)): dropout_prob = 0.4 kernel_init = &amp;#39;glorot_uniform&amp;#39; dis_input = Input(shape = image_shape) # Conv layer 1: discriminator = Conv2D(filters = 64, kernel_size = (4,4), strides = (2,2), padding = &amp;#34;same&amp;#34;, data_format = &amp;#34;channels_last&amp;#34;, kernel_initializer = kernel_init)(dis_input) discriminator = LeakyReLU(0.2)(discriminator) # Conv layer 2: discriminator = Conv2D(filters = 128, kernel_size = (4,4), strides = (2,2), padding = &amp;#34;same&amp;#34;, data_format = &amp;#34;channels_last&amp;#34;, kernel_initializer = kernel_init)(discriminator) discriminator = BatchNormalization(momentum = 0.5)(discriminator) discriminator = LeakyReLU(0.2)(discriminator) # Conv layer 3:  discriminator = Conv2D(filters = 256, kernel_size = (4,4), strides = (2,2), padding = &amp;#34;same&amp;#34;, data_format = &amp;#34;channels_last&amp;#34;, kernel_initializer = kernel_init)(discriminator) discriminator = BatchNormalization(momentum = 0.5)(discriminator) discriminator = LeakyReLU(0.2)(discriminator) # Conv layer 4: discriminator = Conv2D(filters = 512, kernel_size = (4,4), strides = (2,2), padding = &amp;#34;same&amp;#34;, data_format = &amp;#34;channels_last&amp;#34;, kernel_initializer = kernel_init)(discriminator) discriminator = BatchNormalization(momentum = 0.5)(discriminator) discriminator = LeakyReLU(0.2)(discriminator)#discriminator = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(discriminator) # Flatten discriminator = Flatten()(discriminator) # Dense Layer discriminator = Dense(1)(discriminator) # Sigmoid Activation discriminator = Activation(&amp;#39;sigmoid&amp;#39;)(discriminator) # Optimizer and Compiling model dis_opt = Adam(lr=0.0002, beta_1=0.5) discriminator_model = Model(input = dis_input, output = discriminator) discriminator_model.compile(loss=&amp;#39;binary_crossentropy&amp;#39;, optimizer=dis_opt, metrics=[&amp;#39;accuracy&amp;#39;]) discriminator_model.summary() return discriminator_modelplot_model(discriminator, to_file=&amp;#39;dis_plot.png&amp;#39;, show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True)   Discriminator Architecture    Training Understanding how the training works in GAN is essential. And maybe a little interesting too.
I start by creating our discriminator and generator using the functions defined in the previous section:
discriminator = get_disc_normal(image_shape) generator = get_gen_normal(noise_shape) The generator and discriminator are then combined to create the final GAN.
discriminator.trainable = False # Optimizer for the GAN opt = Adam(lr=0.00015, beta_1=0.5) #same as generator # Input to the generator gen_inp = Input(shape=noise_shape) GAN_inp = generator(gen_inp) GAN_opt = discriminator(GAN_inp) # Final GAN gan = Model(input = gen_inp, output = GAN_opt) gan.compile(loss = &amp;#39;binary_crossentropy&amp;#39;, optimizer = opt, metrics=[&amp;#39;accuracy&amp;#39;]) plot_model(gan, to_file=&amp;#39;gan_plot.png&amp;#39;, show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True) This is the architecture of our whole GAN:
The Training Loop This is the main region where we need to understand how the blocks we have created until now assemble and work together to work as one.
# Use a fixed noise vector to see how the GAN Images transition through time on a fixed noise.  fixed_noise = gen_noise(16,noise_shape) # To keep Track of losses avg_disc_fake_loss = [] avg_disc_real_loss = [] avg_GAN_loss = [] # We will run for num_steps iterations for step in range(num_steps): tot_step = step print(&amp;#34;Begin step: &amp;#34;, tot_step) # to keep track of time per step step_begin_time = time.time() # sample a batch of normalized images from the dataset real_data_X = sample_from_dataset(batch_size, image_shape, data_dir=data_dir) # Genearate noise to send as input to the generator noise = gen_noise(batch_size,noise_shape) # Use generator to create(predict) images fake_data_X = generator.predict(noise) # Save predicted images from the generator every 10th step if (tot_step % 100) == 0: step_num = str(tot_step).zfill(4) save_img_batch(fake_data_X,img_save_dir&#43;step_num&#43;&amp;#34;_image.png&amp;#34;) # Create the labels for real and fake data. We don&amp;#39;t give exact ones and zeros but add a small amount of noise. This is an important GAN training trick real_data_Y = np.ones(batch_size) - np.random.random_sample(batch_size)*0.2 fake_data_Y = np.random.random_sample(batch_size)*0.2 # train the discriminator using data and labels discriminator.trainable = True generator.trainable = False # Training Discriminator seperately on real data dis_metrics_real = discriminator.train_on_batch(real_data_X,real_data_Y) # training Discriminator seperately on fake data dis_metrics_fake = discriminator.train_on_batch(fake_data_X,fake_data_Y) print(&amp;#34;Disc: real loss: %ffake loss: %f&amp;#34; % (dis_metrics_real[0], dis_metrics_fake[0])) # Save the losses to plot later avg_disc_fake_loss.append(dis_metrics_fake[0]) avg_disc_real_loss.append(dis_metrics_real[0]) # Train the generator using a random vector of noise and its labels (1&amp;#39;s with noise) generator.trainable = True discriminator.trainable = False GAN_X = gen_noise(batch_size,noise_shape) GAN_Y = real_data_Y gan_metrics = gan.train_on_batch(GAN_X,GAN_Y) print(&amp;#34;GAN loss: %f&amp;#34; % (gan_metrics[0])) # Log results by opening a file in append mode text_file = open(log_dir&#43;&amp;#34;\\training_log.txt&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;a&amp;#34;) text_file.write(&amp;#34;Step: %dDisc: real loss: %ffake loss: %fGAN loss: %f\n&amp;#34; % (tot_step, dis_metrics_real[0], dis_metrics_fake[0],gan_metrics[0])) text_file.close() # save GAN loss to plot later avg_GAN_loss.append(gan_metrics[0]) end_time = time.time() diff_time = int(end_time - step_begin_time) print(&amp;#34;Step %dcompleted.

The main steps in every training iteration are:
Step 1: Sample a batch of normalized images from the dataset directory
# Use a fixed noise vector to see how the GAN Images transition through time on a fixed noise.  fixed_noise = gen_noise(16,noise_shape) # To keep Track of losses avg_disc_fake_loss = [] avg_disc_real_loss = [] avg_GAN_loss = [] # We will run for num_steps iterations for step in range(num_steps): tot_step = step print(&amp;#34;Begin step: &amp;#34;, tot_step) # to keep track of time per step step_begin_time = time.time() # sample a batch of normalized images from the dataset real_data_X = sample_from_dataset(batch_size, image_shape, data_dir=data_dir) Step2:Generate noise for input to the generator
# Generate noise to send as input to the generator noise = gen_noise(batch_size,noise_shape) Step3:Generate images using random noise using the generator.
# Use generator to create(predict) images fake_data_X = generator.predict(noise) # Save predicted images from the generator every 100th step if (tot_step % 100) == 0: step_num = str(tot_step).zfill(4) save_img_batch(fake_data_X,img_save_dir&#43;step_num&#43;&amp;#34;_image.png&amp;#34;) Step 4:Train discriminator using generator images(Fake images) and real normalized images(Real Images) and their noisy labels.
# Create the labels for real and fake data. We don&amp;#39;t give exact ones and zeros but add a small amount of noise. This is an important GAN training trick real_data_Y = np.ones(batch_size) - np.random.random_sample(batch_size)*0.2 fake_data_Y = np.random.random_sample(batch_size)*0.2 # train the discriminator using data and labels discriminator.trainable = True generator.trainable = False # Training Discriminator seperately on real data dis_metrics_real = discriminator.train_on_batch(real_data_X,real_data_Y) # training Discriminator seperately on fake data dis_metrics_fake = discriminator.train_on_batch(fake_data_X,fake_data_Y) print(&amp;#34;Disc: real loss: %ffake loss: %f&amp;#34; % (dis_metrics_real[0], dis_metrics_fake[0])) # Save the losses to plot later avg_disc_fake_loss.append(dis_metrics_fake[0]) avg_disc_real_loss.append(dis_metrics_real[0]) Step 5:Train the GAN using noise as X and 1&amp;rsquo;s(noisy) as Y while keeping discriminator as untrainable.
# Train the generator using a random vector of noise and its labels (1&amp;#39;s with noise) generator.trainable = True discriminator.trainable = False GAN_X = gen_noise(batch_size,noise_shape) GAN_Y = real_data_Y gan_metrics = gan.train_on_batch(GAN_X,GAN_Y) print(&amp;#34;GAN loss: %f&amp;#34; % (gan_metrics[0])) We repeat the steps using the for loop to end up with a good discriminator and generator.
Results The final output image looks like the following. As we can see, the GAN can generate pretty good images for our content editor friends to work with.
They might be a little crude for your liking, but still, this project was a starter for our GAN journey.
     Loss over the training period Here is the graph generated for the losses. We can see that the GAN Loss is decreasing on average and the variance is decreasing too as we do more steps. One might want to train for even more iterations to get better results.
Image generated at every 1500 steps You can see the output and running code in Colab:
# Generating GIF from PNGs import imageio # create a list of PNGs generated_images = [img_save_dir&#43;str(x).zfill(4)&#43;&amp;#34;_image.png&amp;#34; for x in range(0,num_steps,100)] images = [] for filename in generated_images: images.append(imageio.imread(filename)) imageio.mimsave(img_save_dir&#43;&amp;#39;movie.gif&amp;#39;, images) from IPython.display import Image with open(img_save_dir&#43;&amp;#39;movie.gif&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;rb&amp;#39;) as f: display(Image(data=f.read(), format=&amp;#39;png&amp;#39;)) Given below is the code to generate some images at different training steps. As we can see, as the number of steps increases the images are getting better.
# create a list of 20 PNGs to show generated_images = [img_save_dir&#43;str(x).zfill(4)&#43;&amp;#34;fixed_image.png&amp;#34; for x in range(0,num_steps,1500)] print(&amp;#34;Displaying generated images&amp;#34;) # You might need to change grid size and figure size here according to num images.  plt.figure(figsize=(16,20)) gs1 = gridspec.GridSpec(5, 4) gs1.update(wspace=0, hspace=0) for i,image in enumerate(generated_images): ax1 = plt.subplot(gs1[i]) ax1.set_aspect(&amp;#39;equal&amp;#39;) step = image.split(&amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34;)[0] image = Image.open(image) fig = plt.imshow(image) # you might need to change some params here fig = plt.text(20,47,&amp;#34;Step: &amp;#34;&#43;step,bbox=dict(facecolor=&amp;#39;red&amp;#39;, alpha=0.5),fontsize=12) plt.axis(&amp;#39;off&amp;#39;) fig.axes.get_xaxis().set_visible(False) fig.axes.get_yaxis().set_visible(False) plt.tight_layout() plt.savefig(&amp;#34;GENERATEDimage.png&amp;#34;,bbox_inches=&amp;#39;tight&amp;#39;,pad_inches=0) plt.show() Given below is the result of the GAN at different time steps:
Conclusion In this post, we learned about the basics of GAN. We also learned about the Generator and Discriminator architecture for DC-GANs, and we built a simple DC-GAN to generate anime images from scratch.
This model is not very good at generating fake images, yet we get to understand the basics of GANs with this project, and we are fired up to build more exciting and complex GANs as we go forward.
The DC-GAN flavor of GANs is widely applicable not only to generate Faces or new anime characters, but it can also be used to generate new fashion styles, for general content creation and sometimes for data augmentation purposes as well.
We can now conjure up realistic textures or characters on demand if we have the training data at hand, and that is no small feat.

        <![CDATA[    Good Features are the backbone of any machine learning model.
And good feature creation often needs domain knowledge, creativity, and lots of time.
In this post, I am going to talk about:
 Various methods of feature creation- Both Automated and manual
 Different Ways to handle categorical features
 Longitude and Latitude features
 Some kaggle tricks
 And some other ideas to think about feature creation.
  TLDR; this post is about useful feature engineering methods and tricks that I have learned and end up using often.
1. Automatic Feature Creation using featuretools:   Automation is the future    Have you read about featuretools yet? If not, then you are going to be delighted.
Featuretools is a framework to perform automated feature engineering. It excels at transforming temporal and relational datasets into feature matrices for machine learning.
How? Let us work with a toy example to show you the power of featuretools.
Let us say that we have three tables in our database: Customers, Sessions, and Transactions.
  Datasets and relationships          This is a reasonably good toy dataset to work on since it has time-based columns as well as categorical and numerical columns.
If we were to create features on this data, we would need to do a lot of merging and aggregations using Pandas.
Featuretools makes it so easy for us. Though there are a few things, we will need to learn before our life gets easier.
Featuretools works with entitysets.
You can understand an entityset as a bucket for dataframes as well as relationships between them.
  Entityset = Bucket of dataframes and relationships    So without further ado, let us create an empty entityset. I just gave the name as customers. You can use any name here. It is just an empty bucket right now.
# Create new entityset es = ft.EntitySet(id = &amp;#39;customers&amp;#39;) Let us add our dataframes to it. The order of adding dataframes is not important. To add a dataframe to an existing entityset, we do the below operation.
# Create an entity from the customers dataframe es = es.entity_from_dataframe(entity_id = &amp;#39;customers&amp;#39;, dataframe = customers_df, index = &amp;#39;customer_id&amp;#39;, time_index = &amp;#39;join_date&amp;#39; ,variable_types = {&amp;#34;zip_code&amp;#34;: ft.variable_types.ZIPCode}) So here are a few things we did here to add our dataframe to the empty entityset bucket.
 Provided a entity_id: This is just a name. Put it as customers.
 dataframe name set as customers_df
 index : This argument takes as input the primary key in the table
 time_index : The time index is defined as the first time that any information from a row can be used. For customers, it is the joining date. For transactions, it will be the transaction time.
 variable_types: This is used to specify if a particular variable must be handled differently. In our Dataframe, we have the zip_code variable, and we want to treat it differently, so we use this. These are the different variable types we could use:
  [featuretools.variable_types.variable.Datetime, featuretools.variable_types.variable.Numeric, featuretools.variable_types.variable.Timedelta, featuretools.variable_types.variable.Categorical, featuretools.variable_types.variable.Text, featuretools.variable_types.variable.Ordinal, featuretools.variable_types.variable.Boolean, featuretools.variable_types.variable.LatLong, featuretools.variable_types.variable.ZIPCode, featuretools.variable_types.variable.IPAddress, featuretools.variable_types.variable.EmailAddress, featuretools.variable_types.variable.URL, featuretools.variable_types.variable.PhoneNumber, featuretools.variable_types.variable.DateOfBirth, featuretools.variable_types.variable.CountryCode, featuretools.variable_types.variable.SubRegionCode, featuretools.variable_types.variable.FilePath]  This is how our entityset bucket looks right now. It has just got one dataframe in it. And no relationships
  Let us add all our dataframes:
# adding the transactions_df es = es.entity_from_dataframe(entity_id=&amp;#34;transactions&amp;#34;, dataframe=transactions_df, index=&amp;#34;transaction_id&amp;#34;, time_index=&amp;#34;transaction_time&amp;#34;, variable_types={&amp;#34;product_id&amp;#34;: ft.variable_types.Categorical}) # adding sessions_df es = es.entity_from_dataframe(entity_id=&amp;#34;sessions&amp;#34;, dataframe=sessions_df, index=&amp;#34;session_id&amp;#34;, time_index = &amp;#39;session_start&amp;#39;) This is how our entityset buckets look now.
  All three dataframes but no relationships. By relationships, I mean that my bucket doesn’t know that customer_id in customers_df and session_df are the same columns.
We can provide this information to our entityset as:
# adding the customer_id relationship cust_relationship = ft.Relationship(es[&amp;#34;customers&amp;#34;][&amp;#34;customer_id&amp;#34;], es[&amp;#34;sessions&amp;#34;][&amp;#34;customer_id&amp;#34;]) # Add the relationship to the entity set es = es.add_relationship(cust_relationship) # adding the session_id relationship sess_relationship = ft.Relationship(es[&amp;#34;sessions&amp;#34;][&amp;#34;session_id&amp;#34;], es[&amp;#34;transactions&amp;#34;][&amp;#34;session_id&amp;#34;]) # Add the relationship to the entity set es = es.add_relationship(sess_relationship) After this our entityset looks like:
  We can see the datasets as well as the relationships. Most of our work here is done. We are ready to cook features.
  Cooking is no different from feature engineering. Think of features as ingredients.    Creating features is as simple as:
feature_matrix, feature_defs = ft.dfs(entityset=es, target_entity=&amp;#34;customers&amp;#34;,max_depth = 2) feature_matrix.head()   And we end up with 73 new features. You can see the feature names from feature_defs. Some of the features that we end up creating are:
[&amp;lt;Feature: NUM_UNIQUE(sessions.device)&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: MODE(sessions.device)&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: SUM(transactions.amount)&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: STD(transactions.amount)&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: MAX(transactions.amount)&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: SKEW(transactions.amount)&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: DAY(join_date)&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: YEAR(join_date)&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: MONTH(join_date)&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: WEEKDAY(join_date)&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: SUM(sessions.STD(transactions.amount))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: SUM(sessions.MAX(transactions.amount))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: SUM(sessions.SKEW(transactions.amount))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: SUM(sessions.MIN(transactions.amount))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: SUM(sessions.MEAN(transactions.amount))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: SUM(sessions.NUM_UNIQUE(transactions.product_id))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: STD(sessions.SUM(transactions.amount))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: STD(sessions.MAX(transactions.amount))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: STD(sessions.SKEW(transactions.amount))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: STD(sessions.MIN(transactions.amount))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: STD(sessions.MEAN(transactions.amount))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: STD(sessions.COUNT(transactions))&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Feature: STD(sessions.NUM_UNIQUE(transactions.product_id))&amp;gt;]  You can get features like the Sum of std of amount(SUM(sessions.STD(transactions.amount))) or Std of the sum of amount(STD(sessions.SUM(transactions.amount))) This is what max_depth parameter means in the function call. Here we specify it as 2 to get two level aggregations.
If we change max_depth to 3 we can get features like: MAX(sessions.NUM_UNIQUE(transactions.YEAR(transaction_time)))
Just think of how much time you would have to spend if you had to write code to get such features. Also, a caveat is that increasing the max_depth might take longer times.
2. Handling Categorical Features: Label/Binary/Hashing and Target/Mean Encoding Creating automated features has its perks. But why would we data scientists be required if a simple library could do all our work?
This is the section where I will talk about handling categorical features.
One hot encoding   One Hot Coffee    We can use One hot encoding to encode our categorical features. So if we have n levels in a category, we will get n-1 features.
In our sessions_df table, we have a column named device, which contains three levels — desktop, mobile, or tablet. We can get two columns from such a column using:
pd.get_dummies(sessions_df[&amp;#39;device&amp;#39;],drop_first=True)   This is the most natural thing that comes to mind when talking about categorical features and works well in many cases.
OrdinalEncoding Sometimes there is an order associated with categories. In such a case, I usually use a simple map/apply function in pandas to create a new ordinal column.
For example, if I had a dataframe containing temperature as three levels: high medium and low, I would encode that as:
map_dict = {&amp;#39;low&amp;#39;:0,&amp;#39;medium&amp;#39;:1,&amp;#39;high&amp;#39;:2} def map_values(x): return map_dict[x] df[&amp;#39;Temperature_oe&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;Temperature&amp;#39;].apply(lambda x: map_values(x))   Using this I preserve the information that low &amp;lt; medium &amp;lt; high
LabelEncoder We could also have used LabelEncoder to encode our variable to numbers. What a label encoder essentially does is that it sees the first value in the column and converts it to 0, next value to 1 and so on. This approach works reasonably well with tree models, and I end up using it when I have a lot of levels in the categorical variable. We can use this as:
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder # create a labelencoder object le = LabelEncoder() # fit and transform on the data sessions_df[&amp;#39;device_le&amp;#39;] = le.fit_transform(sessions_df[&amp;#39;device&amp;#39;]) sessions_df.head()   BinaryEncoder BinaryEncoder is another method that one can use to encode categorical variables. It is an excellent method to use if you have many levels in a column. While we can encode a column with 1024 levels using 1023 columns using One Hot Encoding, using Binary encoding we can do it by just using ten columns.
Let us say we have a column in our FIFA 19 player data that contains all club names. This column has 652 unique values. One Hot encoding means creating 651 columns that would mean a lot of memory usage and a lot of sparse columns.
If we use Binary encoder, we will only need ten columns as 2⁹&amp;lt;652 &amp;lt;2¹⁰.
We can binaryEncode this variable easily by using BinaryEncoder object from category_encoders:
from category_encoders.binary import BinaryEncoder # create a Binaryencoder object be = BinaryEncoder(cols = [&amp;#39;Club&amp;#39;]) # fit and transform on the data players = be.fit_transform(players)   HashingEncoder   One can think of Hashing Encoder as a black box function that converts a string to a number between 0 to some prespecified value.
It differs from binary encoding as in binary encoding two or more of the club parameters could have been 1 while in hashing only one value is 1.
We can use hashing as:
players = pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;../input/fifa19/data.csv&amp;#34;) from category_encoders.hashing import HashingEncoder # create a HashingEncoder object he = HashingEncoder(cols = [&amp;#39;Club&amp;#39;]) # fit and transform on the data players = he.fit_transform(players)   There are bound to be collisions(two clubs having the same encoding. For example, Juventus and PSG have the same encoding) but sometimes this technique works well.
Target/Mean Encoding   This is a technique that I found works pretty well in Kaggle competitions. If both training/test comes from the same dataset from the same time period(cross-sectional), we can get crafty with features.
For example: In the Titanic knowledge challenge, the test data is randomly sampled from the train data. In this case, we can use the target variable averaged over different categorical variable as a feature.
In Titanic, we can create a target encoded feature over the PassengerClass variable.
We have to be careful when using Target encoding as it might induce overfitting in our models. Thus we use k-fold target encoding when we use it.
# taken from https://medium.com/@pouryaayria/k-fold-target-encoding-dfe9a594874b from sklearn import base from sklearn.model_selection import KFold class KFoldTargetEncoderTrain(base.BaseEstimator, base.TransformerMixin): def __init__(self,colnames,targetName, n_fold=5, verbosity=True, discardOriginal_col=False): self.colnames = colnames self.targetName = targetName self.n_fold = n_fold self.verbosity = verbosity self.discardOriginal_col = discardOriginal_col def fit(self, X, y=None): return self def transform(self,X): assert(type(self.targetName) == str) assert(type(self.colnames) == str) assert(self.colnames in X.columns) assert(self.targetName in X.columns) mean_of_target = X[self.targetName].mean() kf = KFold(n_splits = self.n_fold, shuffle = True, random_state=2019) col_mean_name = self.colnames &#43; &amp;#39;_&amp;#39; &#43; &amp;#39;Kfold_Target_Enc&amp;#39; X[col_mean_name] = np.nan for tr_ind, val_ind in kf.split(X): X_tr, X_val = X.iloc[tr_ind], X.iloc[val_ind] X.loc[X.index[val_ind], col_mean_name] = X_val[self.colnames].map(X_tr.groupby(self.colnames) [self.targetName].mean()) X[col_mean_name].fillna(mean_of_target, inplace = True) if self.verbosity: encoded_feature = X[col_mean_name].values print(&amp;#39;Correlation between the new feature, {} and, {} is {}.&amp;#39;.format(col_mean_name,self.targetName, np.corrcoef(X[self.targetName].values, encoded_feature)[0][1])) if self.discardOriginal_col: X = X.drop(self.targetName, axis=1) return X We can then create a mean encoded feature as:
targetc = KFoldTargetEncoderTrain(&amp;#39;Pclass&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Survived&amp;#39;,n_fold=5) new_train = targetc.fit_transform(train) new_train[[&amp;#39;Pclass_Kfold_Target_Enc&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Pclass&amp;#39;]]   You can see how the passenger class 3 gets encoded as 0.261538 and 0.230570 based on which fold the average is taken from.
This feature is pretty helpful as it encodes the value of the target for the category. Just looking at this feature, we can say that the Passenger in class 1 has a high propensity of surviving compared with Class 3.
3. Some Kaggle Tricks: While not necessarily feature creation techniques, some postprocessing techniques that you may find useful.
log loss clipping Technique: Something that I learned in the Neural Network course by Jeremy Howard. It is based on an elementary Idea.
Log loss penalizes us a lot if we are very confident and wrong.
So in the case of Classification problems where we have to predict probabilities in Kaggle, it would be much better to clip our probabilities between 0.05–0.95 so that we are never very sure about our prediction. And in turn, get penalized less. Can be done by a simple np.clip
Kaggle submission in gzip format: A small piece of code that will help you save countless hours of uploading. Enjoy.
df.to_csv(‘submission.csv.gz’, index=False, compression=’gzip’) 4. Using Latitude and Longitude features: This part will tread upon how to use Latitude and Longitude features well.
For this task, I will be using Data from the Playground competition: New York City Taxi Trip Duration
The train data looks like:
  Most of the functions I am going to write here are inspired by a Kernel on Kaggle written by Beluga.
In this competition, we had to predict the trip duration. We were given many features in which Latitude and Longitude of pickup and Dropoff were also there. We created features like:
A. Haversine Distance Between the Two Lat/Lons:  The haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes
 def haversine_array(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2): lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2 = map(np.radians, (lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2)) AVG_EARTH_RADIUS = 6371 # in km  lat = lat2 - lat1 lng = lng2 - lng1 d = np.sin(lat * 0.5) ** 2 &#43; np.cos(lat1) * np.cos(lat2) * np.sin(lng * 0.5) ** 2 h = 2 * AVG_EARTH_RADIUS * np.arcsin(np.sqrt(d)) return h We could then use the function as:
train[&amp;#39;haversine_distance&amp;#39;] = train.apply(lambda x: haversine_array(x[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;], x[&amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;], x[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;], x[&amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;]),axis=1) B. Manhattan Distance Between the two Lat/Lons:   Manhattan Skyline     The distance between two points measured along axes at right angles
def dummy_manhattan_distance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2): a = haversine_array(lat1, lng1, lat1, lng2) b = haversine_array(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng1) return a &#43; b We could then use the function as:
train[&amp;#39;manhattan_distance&amp;#39;] = train.apply(lambda x: dummy_manhattan_distance(x[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;], x[&amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;], x[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;], x[&amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;]),axis=1) C. Bearing Between the two Lat/Lons: A bearing is used to represent the direction of one point relative to another point.
def bearing_array(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2): AVG_EARTH_RADIUS = 6371 # in km  lng_delta_rad = np.radians(lng2 - lng1) lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2 = map(np.radians, (lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2)) y = np.sin(lng_delta_rad) * np.cos(lat2) x = np.cos(lat1) * np.sin(lat2) - np.sin(lat1) * np.cos(lat2) * np.cos(lng_delta_rad) return np.degrees(np.arctan2(y, x)) We could then use the function as:
train[&amp;#39;bearing&amp;#39;] = train.apply(lambda x: bearing_array(x[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;], x[&amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;], x[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;], x[&amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;]),axis=1) D. Center Latitude and Longitude between Pickup and Dropoff: train.loc[:, &amp;#39;center_latitude&amp;#39;] = (train[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;].values &#43; train[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;].values) / 2 train.loc[:, &amp;#39;center_longitude&amp;#39;] = (train[&amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;].values &#43; train[&amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;].values) / 2 These are the new columns that we create:
  5. AutoEncoders: Sometimes people use Autoencoders too for creating automatic features.
What are Autoencoders?
Encoders are deep learning functions which approximate a mapping from X to X, i.e. input=output. They first compress the input features into a lower-dimensional representation/code and then reconstruct the output from this representation.
  We can use this representation vector as a feature for our models.
6. Some Normal Things you can do with your features:  Scaling by Max-Min: This is good and often required preprocessing for Linear models, Neural Networks
 Normalization using Standard Deviation: This is good and often required preprocessing for Linear models, Neural Networks
 Log-based feature/Target: Use log based features or log-based target function. If one is using a Linear model which assumes that the features are normally distributed, a log transformation could make the feature normal. It is also handy in case of skewed variables like income.
  Or in our case trip duration. Below is the graph of trip duration without log transformation.
  And with log transformation:
train[&amp;#39;log_trip_duration&amp;#39;] = train[&amp;#39;trip_duration&amp;#39;].apply(lambda x: np.log(1&#43;x))   A log transformation on trip duration is much less skewed and thus much more helpful for a model.
7. Some Additional Features based on Intuition: Date time Features: One could create additional Date time features based on domain knowledge and intuition. For example, Time-based Features like “Evening,” “Noon,” “Night,” “Purchases_last_month,” “Purchases_last_week,” etc. could work for a particular application.
Domain Specific Features:   Style matters    Suppose you have got some shopping cart data and you want to categorize the TripType. It was the exact problem in Walmart Recruiting: Trip Type Classification on Kaggle.
Some examples of trip types: a customer may make a small daily dinner trip, a weekly large grocery trip, a trip to buy gifts for an upcoming holiday, or a seasonal trip to buy clothes.
To solve this problem, you could think of creating a feature like “Stylish” where you create this variable by adding together the number of items that belong to category Men’s Fashion, Women’s Fashion, Teens Fashion.
Or you could create a feature like “Rare” which is created by tagging some items as rare, based on the data we have and then counting the number of those rare items in the shopping cart.
Such features might work or might not work. From what I have observed, they usually provide a lot of value.
I feel this is the way that Target’s “Pregnant Teen model” was made. They would have had a variable in which they kept all the items that a pregnant teen could buy and put them into a classification algorithm.
Interaction Features: If you have features A and B, you can create features A*B, A&#43;B, A/B, A-B, etc.
For example, to predict the price of a house, if we have two features length and breadth, a better idea would be to create an area(length x breadth) feature.
Or in some case, a ratio might be more valuable than having two features alone. Example: Credit Card utilization ratio is more valuable than having the Credit limit and limit utilized variables.
Conclusion   Creativity is vital!!!    These were just some of the methods I use for creating features.
But there is surely no limit when it comes to feature engineering, and it is only your imagination that limits you.
On that note, I always think about feature engineering while keeping what model I am going to use in mind. Features that work in a random forest may not work well with Logistic Regression.
Feature creation is the territory of trial and error. You won’t be able to know what transformation works or what encoding works best before trying it. It is always a trade-off between time and utility.
Sometimes the feature creation process might take a lot of time. In such cases, you might want to parallelize your Pandas function.
While I have tried to keep this post as exhaustive as possible, I might have missed some of the useful methods. Let me know about them in the comments.
You can find all the code for this post and run it yourself in this Kaggle Kernel
Take a look at the How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers course in the Advanced machine learning specialization by Kazanova. This course talks about a lot of intuitive ways to improve your model. Definitely recommended.

 “सरहदों पर बहुत तनाव है क्या , पता तो करो चुनाव है क्या !”  For English speakers, this means: Is there a lot of tension at the borders? just ask if the elections are on.
This election India has talked about a lot of issues. News channels have talked about Patriotism, Socialism, Religion as well as terrorism.</description>

        <![CDATA[  It is election month in India and a quote by Dr. Rahat Indori sums it up pretty well.
 “सरहदों पर बहुत तनाव है क्या , पता तो करो चुनाव है क्या !”  For English speakers, this means: Is there a lot of tension at the borders? just ask if the elections are on.
This election India has talked about a lot of issues. News channels have talked about Patriotism, Socialism, Religion as well as terrorism.
You might have heard of the tension brewing between India and Pakistan.
This election season has also been marred with a cacophony of insults. Politicians seem to have forgotten basic manners.
Calling the Prime Minister a Chai-Wala(Tea-Seller) and a Chowkidaar(Watchman). And the Prime Minister accepting both titles with grace and putting a Chowkidaar in front of his name on Twitter too. It was pure genius.
Today is the final phase of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. I urge all those voting in this phase to vote in record numbers. Your one vote will shape India’s development trajectory in the years to come. I also hope first time voters vote enthusiastically.
&amp;mdash; Chowkidar Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 19, 2019 
Now finally the elections are over and the news channels are releasing the exit polls. This is pretty good data to look at.
And why waste good data?
So, here is an effort to showing some of the election data using some interactive visualizations using Flourish.
Recap of Politics in India To give a little perspective, in India, the center is held by BJP(Bhartiya Janta Party) and Narendra Modi is the current prime minister of India.
Most of India’s political history has been dominated by INC(Indian National Congress). This is the party of Mahatma Gandhi. INC’s head Rahul Gandhi, who is sometimes called the 50 years old youth, could be the perfect example of dynastic politics.
There are a lot of other local state parties, which I will call as OTH(Others)
For a perspective to the US audience(very broadly): BJP=Right Wing and INC=Left Wing.
India has 28 states and each state has a number of electoral seats. This is the seat distribution as per states.

Let us talk a little about the swing states.
The first state is Uttar Pradesh. A region of caste-based politics. Holding 8o seats out of 543 seats. A state that could swing the whole election. This state is the home of a large coalition named “MahaGatbandhan”(Literally a large coalition). This coalition is created by two heavy-weights — Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati. Both have totally opposite views, yet they came together to move the BJP government out of the center.
Then there is the case of West Bengal having 42 seats, which is held by Mamata Banerjee. Sometimes people say that it might be a dictatorship and there have been a lot of violent incidents in this state over the past few days.She might also form a coalition with INC in the later stage to overthrow the current government.
All in all, INC, MahaGatbandhan and all others are out there to overthrow BJP(Modi government)
Exit Polls Now the elections are over after 7 phases of voting. And today is the exit polls in India.
That means all the news channels will come up with their individual surveys across the 542 Loksabha seats across the 28 states.
Let us not wait further and look at exit poll data of various news channels.
Here it is:

Seems like a sweeping victory for BJP and alliance.
And here is a racing bar chart of the same.

The only thing that doesn’t seem to move is BJP&#43; and seems like there will be a second term based on this visualization.

The parliament seems to look a little bit orange(BJP Color)though not as much as the last time.
And the swing states. I am going to look at poll data by TimesNow.

While it seems like a defeat for BJP&#43; in West Bengal, more than 10 seats in WB is actually a lot as per the state politics of left and should be categorized as a win.
In Uttar Pradesh too, BJP&#43; was able to handle a great opposition in form of Mahagatbandhan and that seems a win too.
Conclusion The 2019 Mandate seems to be favoring BJP and its allies.
And it is a sweeping answer to people who promote caste-based politics, dynastic rules, and minority appeasement politics.
Here is a tweet showing some frustration by the current CM of West Bengal.
I don’t trust Exit Poll gossip. The game plan is to manipulate or replace thousands of EVMs through this gossip. I appeal to all Opposition parties to be united, strong and bold. We will fight this battle together
&amp;mdash; Mamata Banerjee (@MamataOfficial) May 19, 2019 
While the data seems to show a lot of promise for BJP&#43;, we still need to see if the predictions by these news channels stand up to the actuals. The Election results will be published by 23 May.
I would also like to highlight Flourish here, which made creating the visualizations a breeze.
Visualizations that were Easy to make, Publish and share.
If you want to learn about best strategies for creating Visualizations, I would like to call out an excellent course about Data Visualization and applied plotting from the University of Michigan which is a part of a pretty good Data Science Specialization with Python in itself. Do check it out
I am going to be writing more visualization posts in the future too. Follow me up at Medium or Subscribe to my blog to be informed about them. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism and can be reached on Twitter @mlwhiz.
PS: I am a BJP Supporter but I have tried to be as objective as possible.

        <![CDATA[    Python has a lot of constructs that are reasonably easy to learn and use in our code. Then there are some constructs which always confuse us when we encounter them in our code.
Then are some that even seasoned programmers are not able to understand. *args, **kwargs and decorators are some constructs that fall into this category.
I guess a lot of my data science friends have faced them too.
Most of the seaborn functions use *args and **kwargs in some way or other.
  Or what about decorators?
Every time you see a warning like some function will be deprecated in the next version. The sklearn package uses decorators for that. You can see the @deprecated in the source code. That is a decorator function.
  In this series of posts named Python Shorts I will explain some simple constructs provided by Python, some essential tips and some use cases I come up with regularly in my Data Science work.
This post is about explaining some of the difficult concepts in an easy to understand way.
What are *args? In simple terms,*you can use *args to give an arbitrary number of inputs to your function.*
A simple example: Let us say we have to create a function that adds two numbers. We can do this easily in python.
def adder(x,y): return x&#43;y What if we want to create a function to add three variables?
def adder(x,y,z): return x&#43;y&#43;z What if we want the same function to add an unknown number of variables? Please note that we can use *args or *argv or *anyOtherName to do this. It is the * that matters.
def adder(*args): result = 0 for arg in args: result&#43;=arg return result What *args does is that it takes all your passed arguments and provides a variable length argument list to the function which you can use as you want.
Now you can use the same function as follows:
adder(1,2) adder(1,2,3) adder(1,2,5,7,8,9,100) and so on.
Now, have you ever thought how the print function in python could take so many arguments? *args
What are **kwargs?   In simple terms,you can use **kwargs to give an arbitrary number of Keyworded inputs to your function and access them using a dictionary.
A simple example: Let’s say you want to create a print function that can take a name and age as input and print that.
def myprint(name,age): print(f&amp;#39;{name} is {age} years old&amp;#39;) Simple. Let us now say you want the same function to take two names and two ages.
def myprint(name1,age1,name2,age2): print(f&amp;#39;{name1} is {age1} years old&amp;#39;) print(f&amp;#39;{name2} is {age2} years old&amp;#39;) You guessed right my next question is: What if I don’t know how many arguments I am going to need?
Can I use *args? Guess not since name and age order is essential. We don’t want to write “28 is Michael years old”.
Come **kwargs in the picture.
def myprint(**kwargs): for k,v in kwargs.items(): print(f&amp;#39;{k} is {v} years old&amp;#39;) You can call this function using:
myprint(Sansa=20,Tyrion=40,Arya=17) Output: ----------------------------------- Sansa is 20 years old Tyrion is 40 years old Arya is 17 years old  Remember we never defined Sansa or Arya or Tyrion as our methods arguments.
That is a pretty powerful concept. And many programmers utilize this pretty cleverly when they write wrapper libraries.
For example, seaborn.scatterplot function wraps the plt.scatter function from Matplotlib. Essentially, using *args and **kwargs we can provide all the arguments that plt.scatter can take to seaborn.Scatterplot as well.
This can save a lot of coding effort and also makes the code future proof. If at any time in the future plt.scatter starts accepting any new arguments the seaborn.Scatterplot function will still work.
What are Decorators?   In simple terms: Decorators are functions that wrap another function thus modifying its behavior.
A simple example: Let us say we want to add custom functionality to some of our functions. The functionality is that whenever the function gets called the “function name begins” is printed and whenever the function ends the &amp;ldquo;function name ends” and time taken by the function is printed.
Let us assume our function is:
def somefunc(a,b): output = a&#43;b return output We can add some print lines to all our functions to achieve this.
import time def somefunc(a,b): print(&amp;#34;somefunc begins&amp;#34;) start_time = time.time() output = a&#43;b print(&amp;#34;somefunc ends in &amp;#34;,time.time()-start_time, &amp;#34;secs&amp;#34;) return output out = somefunc(4,5) OUTPUT: ------------------------------------------- somefunc begins somefunc ends in 9.5367431640625e-07 secs  But, Can we do better?
This is where decorators excel. We can use decorators to wrap any function.
from functools import wraps def timer(func): [@wraps](http://twitter.com/wraps)(func) def wrapper(a,b): print(f&amp;#34;{func.__name__!r} begins&amp;#34;) start_time = time.time() func(a,b) print(f&amp;#34;{func.__name__!r} ends in {time.time()-start_time} secs&amp;#34;) return wrapper This is how we can define any decorator. functools helps us create decorators using wraps. In essence, we do something before any function is called and do something after a function is called in the above decorator.
We can now use this timer decorator to decorate our function somefunc
@timer def somefunc(a,b): output = a&#43;b return output Now calling this function, we get:
a = somefunc(4,5) Output --------------------------------------------- &#39;somefunc&#39; begins &#39;somefunc&#39; ends in 2.86102294921875e-06 secs  Now we can append @timer to each of our function for which we want to have the time printed. And we are done.
Really?
Connecting all the pieces   What if our function takes three arguments? Or many arguments?
This is where whatever we have learned till now connects. We use *args and **kwargs
We change our decorator function as:
from functools import wraps def timer(func): [@wraps](http://twitter.com/wraps)(func) def wrapper(*args,**kwargs): print(f&amp;#34;{func.__name__!r} begins&amp;#34;) start_time = time.time() func(*args,**kwargs) print(f&amp;#34;{func.__name__!r} ends in {time.time()-start_time} secs&amp;#34;) return wrapper Now our function can take any number of arguments, and our decorator will still work.
 Isn’t Python Beautiful?  In my view, decorators could be pretty helpful. I provided only one use case of decorators, but there are several ways one can use them.
You can use a decorator to debug code by checking which arguments go in a function. Or a decorator could be used to count the number of times a particular function has been called. This could help with counting recursive calls.
Conclusion In this post, I talked about some of the constructs you can find in python source code and how you can understand them.
It is not necessary that you end up using them in your code now. But I guess understanding how these things work helps mitigate some of the confusion and panic one faces whenever these constructs come up.
 Understanding is vital when it comes to coding  Also if you want to learn more about Python 3, I would like to call out an excellent course on Learn Intermediate level Python from the University of Michigan. Do check it out.

        <![CDATA[    I distinctly remember the time when Seaborn came. I was really so fed up with Matplotlib. To create even simple graphs I had to run through so many StackOverflow threads.
The time I could have spent in thinking good ideas for presenting my data was being spent in handling Matplotlib. And it was frustrating.
Seaborn is much better than Matplotlib, yet it also demands a lot of code for a simple “good looking” graph.
When Plotly came it tried to solve that problem. And when added with Pandas, plotly is a great tool.
Just using the iplot function, you can do so much with Plotly.
But still, it is not very intuitive. At least not for me.
I still didn’t switch to Plotly just because I had spent enough time with Seaborn to do things “quickly” enough and I didn’t want to spend any more time learning a new visualization library. I had created my own functions in Seaborn to create the visualizations I most needed. Yet it was still a workaround. I had given up hope of having anything better.
Comes Plotly Express in the picture. And is it awesome?
According to the creators of Plotly Express (who also created Plotly obviously), Plotly Express is to Plotly what Seaborn is to Matplotlib. &amp;gt; # A terse, consistent, high-level wrapper around Plotly.py for rapid data exploration and figure generation.
I just had to try it out.
And have the creators made it easy to start experimenting with it?
One-liners to do everything you want? ✅
Standardized functions? Learn to create a scatterplot and you have pretty much learned this tool — ✅
Interactive graphs? ✅
Animations? Racing Bar plots, Scatter plots with time, Maps ✅
Free and Open Source? ✅
Just a sneak peek of what we will be able to create(and more) by the end of this post. Using a single line of code.
  Ok enough of the talk, let’s get to it.
First the Dataset — Interesting, Depressing and Inspiring all at once We will be working with the Suicide dataset I took from Kaggle. This dataset is compiled from data taken from the UN, World Bank and World Health Organization. The dataset was accumulated with the inspiration for Suicide Prevention. I am always up for such good use of data.
You can find all the code for this post and run it yourself in this Kaggle Kernel
First I will do some data Cleaning to add continent information and Country ISO codes as they will be helpful later:
import pandas as pd import numpy as np import plotly_express as px # Suicide Data suicides = pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;../input/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016/master.csv&amp;#34;) del suicides[&amp;#39;HDI for year&amp;#39;] del suicides[&amp;#39;country-year&amp;#39;] # Country ISO Codes iso_country_map = pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;../input/countries-iso-codes/wikipedia-iso-country-codes.csv&amp;#34;) iso_country_map = iso_country_map.rename(columns = {&amp;#39;English short name lower case&amp;#39;:&amp;#34;country&amp;#34;}) # Load Country Continents file concap =pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;../input/country-to-continent/countryContinent.csv&amp;#34;, encoding=&amp;#39;iso-8859-1&amp;#39;)[[&amp;#39;code_3&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;continent&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;sub_region&amp;#39;]] concap = concap.rename(columns = {&amp;#39;code_3&amp;#39;:&amp;#34;Alpha-3 code&amp;#34;}) correct_names = {&amp;#39;Cabo Verde&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Cape Verde&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Macau&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Macao&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Republic of Korea&amp;#39;: &amp;#34;Korea, Democratic People&amp;#39;s Republic of&amp;#34; , &amp;#39;Russian Federation&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Russia&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Saint Vincent and Grenadines&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;Saint Vincent and the Grenadines&amp;#39; , &amp;#39;United States&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;United States Of America&amp;#39;} def correct_country(x): if x in correct_names: return correct_names[x] else: return x suicides[&amp;#39;country&amp;#39;] = suicides[&amp;#39;country&amp;#39;].apply(lambda x : correct_country(x)) suicides = pd.merge(suicides,iso_country_map,on=&amp;#39;country&amp;#39;,how=&amp;#39;left&amp;#39;) suicides = pd.merge(suicides,concap,on=&amp;#39;Alpha-3 code&amp;#39;,how=&amp;#39;left&amp;#39;) suicides[&amp;#39;gdp&amp;#39;] = suicides[&amp;#39;gdp_per_capita ($)&amp;#39;]*suicides[&amp;#39;population&amp;#39;] Let us look at the suicides data:
  I will also group the data by continents. Honestly, I am doing this only to show the power of the library as the main objective of this post will still be to create awesome visualizations.
suicides_gby_Continent = suicides.groupby([&amp;#39;continent&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;sex&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;year&amp;#39;]).aggregate(np.sum).reset_index() suicides_gby_Continent[&amp;#39;gdp_per_capita ($)&amp;#39;] = suicides_gby_Continent[&amp;#39;gdp&amp;#39;]/suicides_gby_Continent[&amp;#39;population&amp;#39;] suicides_gby_Continent[&amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;] = suicides_gby_Continent[&amp;#39;suicides_no&amp;#39;]*1000/suicides_gby_Continent[&amp;#39;population&amp;#39;] # 2016 data is not full suicides_gby_Continent=suicides_gby_Continent[suicides_gby_Continent[&amp;#39;year&amp;#39;]!=2016] suicides_gby_Continent.head() The final data we created:
  Simplicity of use We are ready to visualize our data. Comes Plotly Express time. I can install it just by a simple:
pip install plotly_express and import it as:
import plotly_express as px Now let us create a simple scatter plot with it.
suicides_gby_Continent_2007 = suicides_gby_Continent[suicides_gby_Continent[&amp;#39;year&amp;#39;]==2007] px.scatter(suicides_gby_Continent_2007,x = &amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;, y = &amp;#39;gdp_per_capita ($)&amp;#39;)   Not very inspiring. Right. Let us make it better step by step. Lets color the points by Continent.
px.scatter(suicides_gby_Continent_2007,x = &amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;, y = &amp;#39;gdp_per_capita ($)&amp;#39;,color=&amp;#39;continent&amp;#39;)   Better but not inspiring. YET.
The points look so small. Right. Let us increase the point size. How? What could the parameter be….
px.scatter(suicides_gby_Continent_2007,x = &amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;, y = &amp;#39;gdp_per_capita ($)&amp;#39;,color=&amp;#39;ContinentName&amp;#39;,size =&amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;)   Can you see there are two points for every continent? They are for male and female. Let me show that in the graph. We can show this distinction using a couple of ways. We can use different symbol or use different facets for male and female.
Let me show them both.
px.scatter(suicides_gby_Continent_2007,x = &amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;, y = &amp;#39;gdp_per_capita ($)&amp;#39;, size = &amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;, color=&amp;#39;ContinentName&amp;#39;,symbol=&amp;#39;sex&amp;#39;)   We could also create a faceted plot.
px.scatter(suicides_gby_Continent_2007,x = &amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;, y = &amp;#39;gdp_per_capita ($)&amp;#39;, size = &amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;, color=&amp;#39;continent&amp;#39;,facet_col=&amp;#39;sex&amp;#39;)   The triangles are for male and the circles are for females in the symbol chart. We are already starting to see some good info from the chart. For example:
 There is a significant difference between the suicide rates of Male vs Females at least in 2007 data.
 European Males were highly susceptible to Suicide in 2007?
 The income disparity doesn’t seem to play a big role in suicide rates. Asia has a lower GDP per capita and a lower suicide rate than Europe.
 There doesn’t seem to be income disparity amongst males and females.
  Still not inspiring? Umm. Let us add some animation. That shouldn’t have to be hard. I will just add some more parameters,
 animation_frame which specifies what will be our animation dimension.
 range of x and y values using range_y and range_x
 text which labels all points with continents. Helps in visualizing data better
  px.scatter(suicides_gby_Continent,x = &amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;, y = &amp;#39;gdp_per_capita ($)&amp;#39;,color=&amp;#39;continent&amp;#39;, size=&amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;,symbol=&amp;#39;sex&amp;#39;,animation_frame=&amp;#39;year&amp;#39;, animation_group=&amp;#39;continent&amp;#39;,range_x = [0,0.6], range_y = [0,70000],text=&amp;#39;continent&amp;#39;)   Wait for the gif plot to show.
In the Jupyter notebook, you will be able to stop the visualization, hover over the points, just look at a particular continent and do so much more with interactions.
So much information with a single command. We can see that:
 From 1991–2001 European Males had a pretty bad Suicide rate.
 Oceania even after having a pretty high GDP per capita, it is still susceptible to suicides.
 Africa has lower suicide rates as compared to other countries.
 For the Americas, the suicide rates have been increasing gradually.
  All of my above observations would warrant more analysis. But that is the point of having so much information on a single graph. It will help you to come up with a lot of hypotheses.
The above style of the plot is known as Hans Rosling plot named after its founder.
Here I would ask you to see this presentation from Hans Rosling where he uses Gapminder data to explain how income and lifespan emerged in the world through years. See it. It&amp;rsquo;s great.

Function Standardization So till now, we have learned about scatter plots. So much time to just learn a single class of charts. In the start of my post, I told you that this library has a sort of standardized functions.
Let us specifically look at European data as we saw that European males have a high Suicide rate.
european_suicide_data = suicides[suicides[&amp;#39;continent&amp;#39;] ==&amp;#39;Europe&amp;#39;] european_suicide_data_gby = european_suicide_data.groupby([&amp;#39;age&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;sex&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;year&amp;#39;]).aggregate(np.sum).reset_index() european_suicide_data_gby[&amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;] = european_suicide_data_gby[&amp;#39;suicides_no&amp;#39;]*1000/european_suicide_data_gby[&amp;#39;population&amp;#39;] # A single line to create an animated Bar chart too. px.bar(european_suicide_data_gby,x=&amp;#39;age&amp;#39;,y=&amp;#39;suicides/100k pop&amp;#39;,facet_col=&amp;#39;sex&amp;#39;,animation_frame=&amp;#39;year&amp;#39;, animation_group=&amp;#39;age&amp;#39;, category_orders={&amp;#39;age&amp;#39;:[&amp;#39;5-14 years&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;15-24 years&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;25-34 years&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;35-54 years&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;55-74 years&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;75&#43; years&amp;#39;]},range_y=[0,1]) Just like that, we have learned about animating our bar plots too. In the function above I provide a category_order for the axes to force the order of categories since they are ordinal. Rest all is still the same.
We can see that from 1991 to 2001 the suicide rate of 75&#43; males was very high. That might have increased the overall suicide rate for males.
Want to see how the suicide rates decrease in a country using a map? That is why we got the ISO-codes for the country in the data.
How many lines should that take? You guessed right. One.
suicides_map = suicides.groupby([&amp;#39;year&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;country&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Alpha-3 code&amp;#39;]).aggregate(np.sum).reset_index()[[&amp;#39;country&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Alpha-3 code&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;suicides_no&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;population&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;year&amp;#39;]] suicides_map[&amp;#34;suicides/100k pop&amp;#34;]=suicides_map[&amp;#34;suicides_no&amp;#34;]*1000/suicides_map[&amp;#34;population&amp;#34;] px.choropleth(suicides_map, locations=&amp;#34;Alpha-3 code&amp;#34;, color=&amp;#34;suicides/100k pop&amp;#34;, hover_name=&amp;#34;country&amp;#34;, animation_frame=&amp;#34;year&amp;#34;, color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Plasma) The plot above shows how suicide rates have changed over time in different countries and based on the info we get from the plot the coding effort required is minimal. We can see that:
 A lot of countries are missing
 Africa has very few countries in data
 Almost all of Asia is also missing.
  We can get quite a good understanding of our data just by seeing the above graphs.
Animations on the time axis also add up a lot of value as we are able to see all our data using a single graph.
This can help us in finding hidden patterns in the data. And you have to agree, it looks cool too.
Conclusion This was just a preview of Plotly Express. You can do a lot of other things using this library.
The main thing I liked about this library is the way it has tried to simplify graph creation. And how the graphs look cool out of the box.
Just think of the lengths one would have to go to to create the same graphs in Seaborn or Matplotlib or even Plotly. And you will be able to appreciate the power the library provides even more.
There is a bit of lack of documentation for this project by Plotly, but I found that the functions are pretty much well documented. On that note, you can see function definitions using Shift&#43;Tab in Jupyter.
Also as per its announcement article: “Plotly Express is totally free: with its permissive open-source MIT license, you can use it however you like (yes, even in commercial products!).”
So there is no excuse left now to put off that visual. Just get to it…
You can find all the code for this post and run it yourself in this Kaggle Kernel
If you want to learn about best strategies for creating Visualizations, I would like to call out an excellent course about Data Visualization and applied plotting from the University of Michigan which is a part of a pretty good Data Science Specialization with Python in itself. Do check it out

We data scientists have got laptops with quad-core, octa-core, turbo-boost. We work with servers with even more cores and computing power.
But do we really utilize the raw power we have at hand?
Instead, we wait for time taking processes to finish. Sometimes for hours, when urgent deliverables are at hand.
Can we do better? Can we get better?
In this series of posts named Python Shorts, I will explain some simple constructs provided by Python, some essential tips and some use cases I come up with regularly in my Data Science work.
This post is about using the computing power we have at hand and applying it to the data structure we use most.
Problem Statement We have got a huge pandas data frame, and we want to apply a complex function to it which takes a lot of time.
For this post, I will use data from the Quora Insincere Question Classification on Kaggle, and we need to create some numerical features like length, the number of punctuations, etc. on it.
The competition was a Kernel-based competition and the code needed to run in 2 hours. So every minute was essential, and there was too much time going in preprocessing.
Can we use parallelization to get extra performance out of our code?
Yes, we can.
Parallelization using just a single function Can we make all our cores run?
Let me first start with defining the function I want to use to create our features. add_features is the toy function we wish to apply to our data.
import random import pandas as pd import numpy as np from multiprocessing import Pool def add_features(df): df[&amp;#39;question_text&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;question_text&amp;#39;].apply(lambda x:str(x)) df[&amp;#34;lower_question_text&amp;#34;] = df[&amp;#34;question_text&amp;#34;].apply(lambda x: x.lower()) df[&amp;#39;total_length&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;question_text&amp;#39;].apply(len) df[&amp;#39;capitals&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;question_text&amp;#39;].apply(lambda comment: sum(1 for c in comment if c.isupper())) df[&amp;#39;caps_vs_length&amp;#39;] = df.apply(lambda row: float(row[&amp;#39;capitals&amp;#39;])/float(row[&amp;#39;total_length&amp;#39;]), axis=1) df[&amp;#39;num_words&amp;#39;] = df.question_text.str.count(&amp;#39;\S&#43;&amp;#39;) df[&amp;#39;num_unique_words&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;question_text&amp;#39;].apply(lambda comment: len(set(w for w in comment.split()))) df[&amp;#39;words_vs_unique&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;num_unique_words&amp;#39;] / df[&amp;#39;num_words&amp;#39;] df[&amp;#39;num_exclamation_marks&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;question_text&amp;#39;].apply(lambda comment: comment.count(&amp;#39;!&amp;#39;)) df[&amp;#39;num_question_marks&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;question_text&amp;#39;].apply(lambda comment: comment.count(&amp;#39;?&amp;#39;)) df[&amp;#39;num_punctuation&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;question_text&amp;#39;].apply(lambda comment: sum(comment.count(w) for w in &amp;#39;.,;:&amp;#39;)) df[&amp;#39;num_symbols&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;question_text&amp;#39;].apply(lambda comment: sum(comment.count(w) for w in &amp;#39;*&amp;amp;$%&amp;#39;)) df[&amp;#39;num_smilies&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;question_text&amp;#39;].apply(lambda comment: sum(comment.count(w) for w in (&amp;#39;:-)&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;:)&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;;-)&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;;)&amp;#39;))) df[&amp;#39;num_sad&amp;#39;] = df[&amp;#39;question_text&amp;#39;].apply(lambda comment: sum(comment.count(w) for w in (&amp;#39;:-&amp;lt;&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;:()&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;;-()&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;;(&amp;#39;))) df[&amp;#34;mean_word_len&amp;#34;] = df[&amp;#34;question_text&amp;#34;].apply(lambda x: np.mean([len(w) for w in str(x).split()])) return df We can use parallelized apply using the below function.
def parallelize_dataframe(df, func, n_cores=4): df_split = np.array_split(df, n_cores) pool = Pool(n_cores) df = pd.concat(pool.map(func, df_split)) pool.close() pool.join() return df What does it do? It breaks the dataframe into n_cores parts, and spawns n_cores processes which apply the function to all the pieces.
Once it applies the function to all the split dataframes, it just concatenates the split dataframe and returns the full dataframe to us.
How can we use it? It is pretty simple to use.
train = parallelize_dataframe(train_df, add_features) Does this work? To check the performance of this parallelize function, I ran %%timeit magic on this function in my Jupyter notebook in a Kaggle Kernel.
vs. just using the function as it is:
As you can see I gained some performance just by using the parallelize function. And it was using a kaggle kernel which has only got 2 CPUs.
In the actual competition, there was a lot of computation involved, and the add_features function I was using was much more involved. And this parallelize function helped me immensely to reduce processing time and get a Silver medal.
Here is the kernel with the full code.
Conclusion Parallelization is not a silver bullet; it is buckshot. It won’t solve all your problems, and you would still have to work on optimizing your functions, but it is a great tool to have in your arsenal.
Time never comes back, and sometimes we have a shortage of it. At these times we should be able to use parallelization easily.
 Parallelization is not a silver bullet it is a buckshot  Also if you want to learn more about Python 3, I would like to call out an excellent course on Learn Intermediate level Python from the University of Michigan. Do check it out.

        <![CDATA[    Python provides us with many styles of coding.
In a way, it is pretty inclusive.
One can come from any language and start writing Python.
However, learning to write a language and writing a language in an optimized way are two different things.
In this series of posts named Python Shorts, I will explain some simple but very useful constructs provided by Python, some essential tips and some use cases I come up with regularly in my Data Science work.
In this post, I am going to talk about for loops in Python and how you should avoid them whenever possible.
3 Ways of writing a for loop: Let me explain this with a simple example statement.
Suppose you want to take the sum of squares in a list.
This is a valid problem we all face in machine learning whenever we want to calculate the distance between two points in n dimension.
You can do this using loops easily.
In fact, I will show you** three ways to do the same task which I have seen people use and let you choose for yourself which you find the best.**
x = [1,3,5,7,9] sum_squared = 0 for i in range(len(x)): sum_squared&#43;=x[i]**2 Whenever I see the above code in a python codebase, I understand that the person has come from C or Java background.
A **slightly more pythonic way **of doing the same thing is:
x = [1,3,5,7,9] sum_squared = 0 for y in x: sum_squared&#43;=y**2 Better.
I didn’t index the list. And my code is more readable.
But still, the pythonic way to do it is in one line.
x = [1,3,5,7,9] sum_squared = sum([y**2 for y in x]) This approach is called List Comprehension, and this may very well be one of the reasons that I love Python.
You can also use if in a list comprehension.
Let’s say we wanted a list of squared numbers for even numbers only.
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] even_squared = [y**2 for y in x if y%2==0] -------------------------------------------- [4,16,36,64] if-else?
What if we wanted to have the number squared for even and cubed for odd?
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] squared_cubed = [y**2 if y%2==0 else y**3 for y in x] -------------------------------------------- [1, 4, 27, 16, 125, 36, 343, 64, 729] Great!!!
  So basically follow specific guidelines: Whenever you feel like writing a for statement, you should ask yourself the following questions,
 Can it be done without a for loop? Most Pythonic
 Can it be done using list comprehension? If yes, use it.
 Can I do it without indexing arrays? if not, think about using enumerate
  What is enumerate?
Sometimes we need both the index in an array as well as the value in an array.
In such cases, I prefer to use enumerate rather than indexing the list.
L = [&amp;#39;blue&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;yellow&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;] for i, val in enumerate(L): print(&amp;#34;index is %dand value is %s&amp;#34; % (i, val)) --------------------------------------------------------------- index is 0 and value is blue index is 1 and value is yellow index is 2 and value is orange The rule is:
 Never index a list, if you can do without it.  Try Using Dictionary Comprehension Also try using dictionary comprehension, which is a relatively new addition in Python. The syntax is pretty similar to List comprehension.
Let me explain using an example. I want to get a dictionary with (key: squared value) for every value in x.
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] {k:k**2 for k in x} --------------------------------------------------------- {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81} What if I want a dict only for even values?
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] {k:k**2 for k in x if x%2==0} --------------------------------------------------------- {2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36, 8: 64} What if we want squared value for even key and cubed number for the odd key?
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] {k:k**2 if k%2==0 else k**3 for k in x} --------------------------------------------------------- {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 27, 4: 16, 5: 125, 6: 36, 7: 343, 8: 64, 9: 729} Conclusion To conclude, I will say that while it might seem easy to transfer the knowledge you acquired from other languages to Python, you won’t be able to appreciate the beauty of Python if you keep doing that. Python is much more powerful when we use its ways and decidedly much more fun.
So, use List Comprehensions and Dict comprehensions when you need afor loop. Use enumerate if you need array index.
 Avoid for loops like plague  Your code will be much more readable and maintainable in the long run.

  However, learning to write a language and writing a language in an optimized way are two different things.
Every Language has some ingredients which make it unique.
Yet, a new programmer to any language will always do some forced overfitting. A Java programmer, new to python, for example, might write this code to add numbers in a list.
x=[1,2,3,4,5] sum_x = 0 for i in range(len(x)): sum_x&#43;=x[i] While a python programmer will naturally do this:
sum_x = sum(x) In this series of posts named ‘Python Shorts’, I will explain some simple constructs that Python provides, some essential tips and some use cases I come up with regularly in my Data Science work.
This series is about efficient and readable code.
Counter and defaultdict — Use Cases   Let’s say I need to count the number of word occurrences in a piece of text. Maybe for a book like Hamlet. How could I do that?
Python always provides us with multiple ways to do the same thing. But only one way that I find elegant.
This is a Naive Python implementation using the dict object.
text = &amp;#34;I need to count the number of word occurrences in a piece of text. How could I do that? Python provides us with multiple ways to do the same thing. But only one way I find beautiful.&amp;#34; word_count_dict = {} for w in text.split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;): if w in word_count_dict: word_count_dict[w]&#43;=1 else: word_count_dict[w]=1 We could use defaultdict to reduce the number of lines in the code.
from Collections import defaultdict word_count_dict = defaultdict(int) for w in text.split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;): word_count_dict[w]&#43;=1 We could also have used Counter to do this.
from Collections import Counter word_count_dict = Counter() for w in text.split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;): word_count_dict[w]&#43;=1 If we use Counter, we can also get the most common words using a simple function.
word_count_dict.most_common(10) --------------------------------------------------------------- [(&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;, 3), (&amp;#39;to&amp;#39;, 2), (&amp;#39;the&amp;#39;, 2)] Other use cases of Counter:
# Count Characters Counter(&amp;#39;abccccccddddd&amp;#39;) --------------------------------------------------------------- Counter({&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;: 1, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;: 1, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;: 6, &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;: 5}) # Count List elements Counter([1,2,3,4,5,1,2]) --------------------------------------------------------------- Counter({1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}) So, why ever use defaultdict ? Notice that in Counter, the value is always an integer.
What if we wanted to parse through a list of tuples and wanted to create a dictionary of key and list of values.
The main functionality provided by a defaultdict is that it defaults a key to empty/zero if it is not found in the defaultdict.
s = [(&amp;#39;color&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;blue&amp;#39;), (&amp;#39;color&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;), (&amp;#39;color&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;yellow&amp;#39;), (&amp;#39;fruit&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;banana&amp;#39;), (&amp;#39;fruit&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;),(&amp;#39;fruit&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;banana&amp;#39;)] d = defaultdict(list) for k, v in s: d[k].append(v) print(d) --------------------------------------------------------------- defaultdict(&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;list&amp;#39;&amp;gt;, {&amp;#39;color&amp;#39;: [&amp;#39;blue&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;yellow&amp;#39;], &amp;#39;fruit&amp;#39;: [&amp;#39;banana&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;banana&amp;#39;]}) banana comes two times in fruit, we could use set
d = defaultdict(set) for k, v in s: d[k].add(v) print(d) --------------------------------------------------------------- defaultdict(&amp;lt;class &amp;#39;set&amp;#39;&amp;gt;, {&amp;#39;color&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;yellow&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;blue&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;}, &amp;#39;fruit&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;banana&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;orange&amp;#39;}}) Conclusion To conclude, I will say that there is always a beautiful way to do anything in Python. Search for it before you write code. Going to StackOverflow is okay. I go there a lot of times when I get stuck. Always Remember:
 Creating a function for what already is provided is not pythonic.
 Also if you want to learn more about Python 3, I would like to call out an excellent course on Learn Intermediate level Python from the University of Michigan. Do check it out.

        <![CDATA[    Visualizations are awesome. However, a good visualization is annoyingly hard to make.
Moreover, it takes time and effort when it comes to present these visualizations to a bigger audience.
We all know how to make Bar-Plots, Scatter Plots, and Histograms, yet we don&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention to beautify them.
This hurts us - our credibility with peers and managers. You won&amp;rsquo;t feel it now, but it happens.
Also, I find it essential to reuse my code. Every time I visit a new dataset do I need to start again? Some reusable ideas of graphs that can help us to find information about the data FAST.
In this post, I am also going to talk about 3 cool visual tools:
 Categorical Correlation with Graphs, Pairplots, Swarmplots and Graph Annotations using Seaborn.  In short, this post is about useful and presentable graphs.
I will be using data from FIFA 19 complete player dataset on kaggle - Detailed attributes for every player registered in the latest edition of FIFA 19 database.
Since the Dataset has many columns, we will only focus on a subset of categorical and continuous columns.
import numpy as np import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline # We dont Probably need the Gridlines. Do we? If yes comment this line sns.set(style=&amp;#34;ticks&amp;#34;) player_df = pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;../input/data.csv&amp;#34;) numcols = [ &amp;#39;Overall&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Potential&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Crossing&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Finishing&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;ShortPassing&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Dribbling&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;LongPassing&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;BallControl&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Acceleration&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;SprintSpeed&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Agility&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Stamina&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Value&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Wage&amp;#39;] catcols = [&amp;#39;Name&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Club&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Nationality&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Preferred Foot&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Position&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Body Type&amp;#39;] # Subset the columns player_df = player_df[numcols&#43; catcols] # Few rows of data player_df.head(5)   Player Data    This is a nicely formatted data, yet we need to do some preprocessing to the Wage and Value columns(as they are in Euro and contain strings) to make them numeric for our subsequent analysis.
def wage_split(x): try: return int(x.split(&amp;#34;K&amp;#34;)[0][1:]) except: return 0 player_df[&amp;#39;Wage&amp;#39;] = player_df[&amp;#39;Wage&amp;#39;].apply(lambda x : wage_split(x)) def value_split(x): try: if &amp;#39;M&amp;#39; in x: return float(x.split(&amp;#34;M&amp;#34;)[0][1:]) elif &amp;#39;K&amp;#39; in x: return float(x.split(&amp;#34;K&amp;#34;)[0][1:])/1000 except: return 0 player_df[&amp;#39;Value&amp;#39;] = player_df[&amp;#39;Value&amp;#39;].apply(lambda x : value_split(x)) Categorical Correlation with Graphs: In Simple terms, Correlation is a measure of how two variables move together.
For example, In the real world, Income and Spend are positively correlated. If one increases the other also increases.
Academic Performance and Video Games Usage is negatively correlated. Increase in one predicts a decrease in another.
So if our predictor variable is positively or negatively correlated with our target variable, it is valuable.
I feel that Correlations among different variables are a pretty good thing to do when we try to understand our data.
We can create a pretty good correlation plot using Seaborn easily.
corr = player_df.corr() g = sns.heatmap(corr, vmax=.3, center=0, square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={&amp;#34;shrink&amp;#34;: .5}, annot=True, fmt=&amp;#39;.2f&amp;#39;, cmap=&amp;#39;coolwarm&amp;#39;) sns.despine() g.figure.set_size_inches(14,10) plt.show()   Where did all the categorical variables go?    But do you notice any problem?
Yes, this graph only calculates Correlation between Numerical columns. What if my target variable is Club or Position?
I want to be able to get a correlation among three different cases, and we use the following metrics of correlation to calculate these:
1. Numerical Variables We already have this in the form of Pearson&amp;rsquo;s Correlation which is a measure of how two variables move together. This Ranges from [-1,1]
2. Categorical Variables We will use Cramer&amp;rsquo;s V for categorical-categorical cases. It is the intercorrelation of two discrete variables and used with variables having two or more levels. It is a symmetrical measure as in the order of variable does not matter. Cramer(A,B) == Cramer(B,A).
For Example: In our dataset, Club and Nationality must be somehow correlated.
Let us check this using a stacked graph which is an excellent way to understand distribution between categorical vs. categorical variables. Note that we use a subset of data since there are a lot of nationalities and club in this data.
We keep only the best teams(Kept FC Porto just for more diversity in the sample)and the most common nationalities.
  Note that Club preference says quite a bit about Nationality: knowing the former helps a lot in predicting the latter.
We can see that if a player belongs to England, it is more probable that he plays in Chelsea or Manchester United and not in FC Barcelona or Bayern Munchen or Porto.
So there is some information present here. Cramer&amp;rsquo;s V captures the same information.
If all clubs have the same proportion of players from every nationality, Cramer&amp;rsquo;s V is 0.
If Every club prefers a single nationality Cramer&amp;rsquo;s V ==1, for example, all England player play in Manchester United, All Germans in Bayern Munchen and so on.
In all other cases, it ranges from [0,1]
3. Numerical and Categorical variables We will use the Correlation Ratio for categorical-continuous cases.
Without getting into too much Maths, it is a measure of Dispersion.
 Given a number can we find out which category it belongs to?
 For Example:
Suppose we have two columns from our dataset: SprintSpeed and Position:
 GK: 58(De Gea),52(T. Courtois), 58(M. Neuer), 43(G. Buffon) CB: 68(D. Godin), 59(V. Kompany), 73(S. Umtiti), 75(M. Benatia) ST: 91(C.Ronaldo), 94(G. Bale), 80(S.Aguero), 76(R. Lewandowski)  As you can see these numbers are pretty predictive of the bucket they fall into and thus high Correlation Ratio.
If I know the sprint speed is more than 85, I can definitely say this player plays at ST.
This ratio also ranges from [0,1]
The code to do this is taken from the dython package. I won&amp;rsquo;t write too much into code which you can anyway find in my Kaggle Kernel. The final result looks something like:
player_df = player_df.fillna(0) results = associations(player_df,nominal_columns=catcols,return_results=True)   Categorical vs. Categorical, Categorical vs. Numeric, Numeric vs. Numeric. Much more interesting    Isn&amp;rsquo;t it Beautiful?
We can understand so much about Football just by looking at this data. For Example:
 The position of a player is highly correlated with dribbling ability. You won&amp;rsquo;t play Messi at the back. Right?
 Value is more highly correlated with passing and ball control than dribbling. The rule is to pass the ball always. Neymar I am looking at you.
 Club and Wage have high Correlation. To be expected.
 Body Type and Preferred Foot is correlated highly. Does that mean if you are Lean, you are most likely left-footed? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense. One can investigate further.
  Moreover, so much info we could find with this simple graph which was not visible in the typical correlation plot without Categorical Variables.
I leave it here at that. One can look more into the chart and find more meaningful results, but the point is that this makes life so much easier to find patterns.
Pairplots While I talked a lot about correlation, it is a fickle metric.
To understand what I mean let us see one example.
Anscombe&amp;rsquo;s quartet comprises four datasets that have nearly identical Correlation of 1, yet have very different distributions and appear very different when graphed.
  Anscombe Quartet - Correlations can be fickle.    Thus sometimes it becomes crucial to plot correlated data. And see the distributions individually.
Now we have many columns in our dataset. Graphing them all would be so much effort.
No, it is a single line of code.
filtered_player_df = player_df[(player_df[&amp;#39;Club&amp;#39;].isin([&amp;#39;FC Barcelona&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Paris Saint-Germain&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Manchester United&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Manchester City&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Chelsea&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Real Madrid&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;FC Porto&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;FC Bayern München&amp;#39;])) &amp;amp; (player_df[&amp;#39;Nationality&amp;#39;].isin([&amp;#39;England&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Brazil&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Argentina&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Brazil&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Italy&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Spain&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Germany&amp;#39;])) ] # Single line to create pairplot g = sns.pairplot(filtered_player_df[[&amp;#39;Value&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;SprintSpeed&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Potential&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Wage&amp;#39;]])   Pretty Good. We can see so much in this graph.
 Wage and Value are highly correlated.
 Most of the other values are correlated too. However, the trend of potential vs. value is unusual. We can see how the value increases exponentially as we reach a particular potential threshold. This information can be helpful in modeling. Can use some transformation on Potential to make it more correlated?
  Caveat: No categorical columns.
Can we do better? We always can.
g = sns.pairplot(filtered_player_df[[&amp;#39;Value&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;SprintSpeed&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Potential&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Wage&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Club&amp;#39;]],hue = &amp;#39;Club&amp;#39;)   So much more info. Just by adding the hue parameter as a categorical variable Club.
 Porto&amp;rsquo;s Wage distribution is too much towards the lower side. I don&amp;rsquo;t see that steep distribution in value of Porto players. Porto&amp;rsquo;s players would always be looking out for an opportunity. See how a lot of pink points(Chelsea) form sort of a cluster on Potential vs. wage graph. Chelsea has a lot of high potential players with lower wages. Needs more attention.  I already know some of the points on the Wage/Value Subplot.
The blue point for wage 500k is Messi. Also, the orange point having more value than Messi is Neymar.
Although this hack still doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve the Categorical problem, I have something cool to look into categorical variables distribution. Though individually.
SwarmPlots How to see the relationship between categorical and numerical data?
Enter into picture Swarmplots, just like their name. A swarm of points plotted for each category with a little dispersion on the y-axis to make them easier to see.
They are my current favorite for plotting such relationships.
g = sns.swarmplot(y = &amp;#34;Club&amp;#34;, x = &amp;#39;Wage&amp;#39;, data = filtered_player_df, # Decrease the size of the points to avoid crowding  size = 7) # remove the top and right line in graph sns.despine() g.figure.set_size_inches(14,10) plt.show()   Swarmplot...    Why don&amp;rsquo;t I use Boxplots? Where are the median values? Can I plot that? Obviously. Overlay a bar plot on top, and we have a great looking graph.
g = sns.boxplot(y = &amp;#34;Club&amp;#34;, x = &amp;#39;Wage&amp;#39;, data = filtered_player_df, whis=np.inf) g = sns.swarmplot(y = &amp;#34;Club&amp;#34;, x = &amp;#39;Wage&amp;#39;, data = filtered_player_df, # Decrease the size of the points to avoid crowding  size = 7,color = &amp;#39;black&amp;#39;) # remove the top and right line in graph sns.despine() g.figure.set_size_inches(12,8) plt.show()   Swarmplot&#43;Boxplot, Interesting    Pretty good. We can see the individual points on the graph, see some statistics and understand the wage difference categorically.
The far right point is Messi. However, I should not have to tell you that in a text below the chart. Right?
This graph is going to go in a presentation. Your boss says. I want to write Messi on this graph. Comes into picture annotations.
max_wage = filtered_player_df.Wage.max() max_wage_player = filtered_player_df[(player_df[&amp;#39;Wage&amp;#39;] == max_wage)][&amp;#39;Name&amp;#39;].values[0] g = sns.boxplot(y = &amp;#34;Club&amp;#34;, x = &amp;#39;Wage&amp;#39;, data = filtered_player_df, whis=np.inf) g = sns.swarmplot(y = &amp;#34;Club&amp;#34;, x = &amp;#39;Wage&amp;#39;, data = filtered_player_df, # Decrease the size of the points to avoid crowding  size = 7,color=&amp;#39;black&amp;#39;) # remove the top and right line in graph sns.despine() # Annotate. xy for coordinate. max_wage is x and 0 is y. In this plot y ranges from 0 to 7 for each level # xytext for coordinates of where I want to put my text plt.annotate(s = max_wage_player, xy = (max_wage,0), xytext = (500,1), # Shrink the arrow to avoid occlusion arrowprops = {&amp;#39;facecolor&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;gray&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;width&amp;#39;: 3, &amp;#39;shrink&amp;#39;: 0.03}, backgroundcolor = &amp;#39;white&amp;#39;) g.figure.set_size_inches(12,8) plt.show()   Annotated, Statistical Info and point swarm. To the presentation, I go.     See Porto Down there. Competing with the giants with such a small wage budget. So many Highly paid players in Real and Barcelona. Manchester City has the highest median Wage. Manchester United and Chelsea believes in equality. Many players clustered in around the same wage scale. I am happy that while Neymar is more valued than Messi, Messi and Neymar have a huge Wage difference.  A semblance of normalcy in this crazy world.
So to recap, in this post, we talked about calculating and reading correlations between different variable types, plotting correlations between numerical data and Plotting categorical data with Numerical data using Swarmplots. I love how we can overlay chart elements on top of each other in Seaborn.
Also if you want to learn more about Visualizations, I would like to call out an excellent course about Data Visualization and applied plotting from the University of Michigan which is a part of a pretty good Data Science Specialization with Python in itself. Do check it out

        <![CDATA[    Recently I started up with a competition on kaggle on text classification, and as a part of the competition, I had to somehow move to Pytorch to get deterministic results. Now I have always worked with Keras in the past and it has given me pretty good results, but somehow I got to know that the CuDNNGRU/CuDNNLSTM layers in keras are not deterministic, even after setting the seeds. So Pytorch did come to rescue. And am I glad that I moved.
As a side note: if you want to know more about NLP, I would like to recommend this awesome course on Natural Language Processing in the Advanced machine learning specialization. You can start for free with the 7-day Free Trial. This course covers a wide range of tasks in Natural Language Processing from basic to advanced: Sentiment Analysis, summarization, dialogue state tracking, to name a few.
Also take a look at my other post: Text Preprocessing Methods for Deep Learning, which talks about different preprocessing techniques you can use for your NLP task and What Kagglers are using for Text Classification, which talks about various deep learning models in use in NLP.
Ok back to the task at hand. While Keras is great to start with deep learning, with time you are going to resent some of its limitations. I sort of thought about moving to Tensorflow. It seemed like a good transition as TF is the backend of Keras. But was it hard? With the whole session.run commands and tensorflow sessions, I was sort of confused. It was not Pythonic at all.
Pytorch helps in that since it seems like the python way to do things. You have things under your control and you are not losing anything on the performance front. In the words of Andrej Karpathy:
I&amp;#39;ve been using PyTorch a few months now and I&amp;#39;ve never felt better. I have more energy. My skin is clearer. My eye sight has improved.
&amp;mdash; Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) May 26, 2017 
So without further ado let me translate Keras to Pytorch for you.
The Classy way to write your network?   Ok, let us create an example network in keras first which we will try to port into Pytorch. Here I would like to give a piece of advice too. When you try to move from Keras to Pytorch take any network you have and try porting it to Pytorch. It will make you understand Pytorch in a much better way. Here I am trying to write one of the networks that gave pretty good results in the Quora Insincere questions classification challenge for me. This model has all the bells and whistles which at least any Text Classification deep learning network could contain with its GRU, LSTM and embedding layers and also a meta input layer. And thus would serve as a good example. Also if you want to read up more on how the BiLSTM/GRU and Attention model work do visit my post here.
def get_model(features,clipvalue=1.,num_filters=40,dropout=0.1,embed_size=501): features_input = Input(shape=(features.shape[1],)) inp = Input(shape=(maxlen, )) # Layer 1: Word2Vec Embeddings. x = Embedding(max_features, embed_size, weights=[embedding_matrix], trainable=False)(inp) # Layer 2: SpatialDropout1D(0.1) x = SpatialDropout1D(dropout)(x) # Layer 3: Bidirectional CuDNNLSTM x = Bidirectional(LSTM(num_filters, return_sequences=True))(x) # Layer 4: Bidirectional CuDNNGRU x, x_h, x_c = Bidirectional(GRU(num_filters, return_sequences=True, return_state = True))(x) # Layer 5: some pooling operations avg_pool = GlobalAveragePooling1D()(x) max_pool = GlobalMaxPooling1D()(x) # Layer 6: A concatenation of the last state, maximum pool, average pool and  # additional features x = concatenate([avg_pool, x_h, max_pool,features_input]) # Layer 7: A dense layer x = Dense(16, activation=&amp;#34;relu&amp;#34;)(x) # Layer 8: A dropout layer x = Dropout(0.1)(x) # Layer 9: Output dense layer with one output for our Binary Classification problem. outp = Dense(1, activation=&amp;#34;sigmoid&amp;#34;)(x) # Some keras model creation and compiling model = Model(inputs=[inp,features_input], outputs=outp) adam = optimizers.adam(clipvalue=clipvalue) model.compile(loss=&amp;#39;binary_crossentropy&amp;#39;, optimizer=adam, metrics=[&amp;#39;accuracy&amp;#39;]) return model So a model in pytorch is defined as a class(therefore a little more classy) which inherits from nn.module . Every class necessarily contains an __init__ procedure block and a block for the forward pass.
 In the __init__ part the user defines all the layers the network is going to have but doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet define how those layers would be connected to each other
 In the forward pass block, the user defines how data flows from one layer to another inside the network.
  Why is this Classy? Obviously classy because of Classes. Duh! But jokes apart, I found it beneficial due to a couple of reasons:
1) It gives you a lot of control on how your network is built.
2) You understand a lot about the network when you are building it since you have to specify input and output dimensions. So ** fewer chances of error**. (Although this one is really up to the skill level)
3) Easy to debug networks. Any time you find any problem with the network just use something like print(&amp;quot;avg_pool&amp;quot;, avg_pool.size()) in the forward pass to check the sizes of the layer and you will debug the network easily
4) You can return multiple outputs from the forward layer. This is pretty helpful in the Encoder-Decoder architecture where you can return both the encoder and decoder output. Or in the case of autoencoder where you can return the output of the model and the hidden layer embedding for the data.
5) Pytorch tensors work in a very similar manner to numpy arrays. For example, I could have used Pytorch Maxpool function to write the maxpool layer but max_pool, _ = torch.max(h_gru, 1) will also work.
6) You can set up different layers with different initialization schemes. Something you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do in Keras. For example, in the below network I have changed the initialization scheme of my LSTM layer. The LSTM layer has different initializations for biases, input layer weights, and hidden layer weights.
7) Wait until you see the training loop in Pytorch You will be amazed at the sort of control it provides.
Now the same model in Pytorch will look like something like this. Do go through the code comments to understand more on how to port.

One thing I would like to emphasize here is that you need to code something up in Pytorch to really understand how it works. And know that once you do that you would be glad that you put in the effort. On to the next section.
Tailored or Readymade: The Best Fit with a highly customizable Training Loop   In the above section I wrote that you will be amazed once you saw the training loop. That was an exaggeration. On the first try you will be a little baffled/confused. But as soon as you read through the loop more than once it will make a lot of intuituve sense. Once again read up the comments and the code to gain a better understanding.
This training loop does k-fold cross-validation on your training data and outputs Out-of-fold train_preds and test_preds averaged over the runs on the test data. I apologize if the flow looks something straight out of a kaggle competition, but if you understand this you would be able to create a training loop for your own workflow. And that is the beauty of Pytorch.
So a brief summary of this loop are as follows:
 Create stratified splits using train data Loop through the splits.  Convert your train and CV data to tensor and load your data to the GPU using the X_train_fold = torch.tensor(x_train[train_idx.astype(int)], dtype=torch.long).cuda() command Load the model onto the GPU using the model.cuda() command Define Loss function, Scheduler and Optimizer create train_loader and valid_loader` to iterate through batches. Start running epochs. In each epoch  Set the model mode to train using model.train(). Go through the batches in train_loader and run the forward pass Run a scheduler step to change the learning rate Compute loss Set the existing gradients in the optimizer to zero Backpropagate the losses through the network Clip the gradients Take an optimizer step to change the weights in the whole network Set the model mode to eval using model.eval(). Get predictions for the validation data using valid_loader and store in variable valid_preds_fold Calculate Loss and print  After all epochs are done. Predict the test data and store the predictions. These predictions will be averaged at the end of the split loop to get the final test_preds Get Out-of-fold(OOF) predictions for train set using train_preds[valid_idx] = valid_preds_fold These OOF predictions can then be used to calculate the Local CV score for your model.   def pytorch_model_run_cv(x_train,y_train,features,x_test, model_obj, feats = False,clip = True): seed_everything() avg_losses_f = [] avg_val_losses_f = [] # matrix for the out-of-fold predictions train_preds = np.zeros((len(x_train))) # matrix for the predictions on the test set test_preds = np.zeros((len(x_test))) splits = list(StratifiedKFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=SEED).split(x_train, y_train)) for i, (train_idx, valid_idx) in enumerate(splits): seed_everything(i*1000&#43;i) x_train = np.array(x_train) y_train = np.array(y_train) if feats: features = np.array(features) x_train_fold = torch.tensor(x_train[train_idx.astype(int)], dtype=torch.long).cuda() y_train_fold = torch.tensor(y_train[train_idx.astype(int), np.newaxis], dtype=torch.float32).cuda() if feats: kfold_X_features = features[train_idx.astype(int)] kfold_X_valid_features = features[valid_idx.astype(int)] x_val_fold = torch.tensor(x_train[valid_idx.astype(int)], dtype=torch.long).cuda() y_val_fold = torch.tensor(y_train[valid_idx.astype(int), np.newaxis], dtype=torch.float32).cuda() model = copy.deepcopy(model_obj) model.cuda() loss_fn = torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(reduction=&amp;#39;sum&amp;#39;) step_size = 300 base_lr, max_lr = 0.001, 0.003 optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, model.parameters()), lr=max_lr) ################################################################################################ scheduler = CyclicLR(optimizer, base_lr=base_lr, max_lr=max_lr, step_size=step_size, mode=&amp;#39;exp_range&amp;#39;, gamma=0.99994) ############################################################################################### train = MyDataset(torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(x_train_fold, y_train_fold)) valid = MyDataset(torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(x_val_fold, y_val_fold)) train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True) valid_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(valid, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False) print(f&amp;#39;Fold {i &#43; 1}&amp;#39;) for epoch in range(n_epochs): start_time = time.time() model.train() avg_loss = 0. for i, (x_batch, y_batch, index) in enumerate(train_loader): if feats: f = kfold_X_features[index] y_pred = model([x_batch,f]) else: y_pred = model(x_batch) if scheduler: scheduler.batch_step() # Compute and print loss. loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch) optimizer.zero_grad() loss.backward() if clip: nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(),1) optimizer.step() avg_loss &#43;= loss.item() / len(train_loader) model.eval() valid_preds_fold = np.zeros((x_val_fold.size(0))) test_preds_fold = np.zeros((len(x_test))) avg_val_loss = 0. for i, (x_batch, y_batch,index) in enumerate(valid_loader): if feats: f = kfold_X_valid_features[index] y_pred = model([x_batch,f]).detach() else: y_pred = model(x_batch).detach() avg_val_loss &#43;= loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch).item() / len(valid_loader) valid_preds_fold[index] = sigmoid(y_pred.cpu().numpy())[:, 0] elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time print(&amp;#39;Epoch {}/{} \tloss={:.4f} \tval_loss={:.4f} \ttime={:.2f}s&amp;#39;.format( epoch &#43; 1, n_epochs, avg_loss, avg_val_loss, elapsed_time)) avg_losses_f.append(avg_loss) avg_val_losses_f.append(avg_val_loss) # predict all samples in the test set batch per batch for i, (x_batch,) in enumerate(test_loader): if feats: f = test_features[i * batch_size:(i&#43;1) * batch_size] y_pred = model([x_batch,f]).detach() else: y_pred = model(x_batch).detach() test_preds_fold[i * batch_size:(i&#43;1) * batch_size] = sigmoid(y_pred.cpu().numpy())[:, 0] train_preds[valid_idx] = valid_preds_fold test_preds &#43;= test_preds_fold / len(splits) print(&amp;#39;All \tloss={:.4f} \tval_loss={:.4f} \t&amp;#39;.format(np.average(avg_losses_f),np.average(avg_val_losses_f))) return train_preds, test_preds But Why? Why so much code? Okay. I get it. That was probably a handful. What you could have done with a simple.fit in keras, takes a lot of code to accomplish in Pytorch. But understand that you get a lot of power too. Some use cases for you to understand:
 While in Keras you have prespecified schedulers like ReduceLROnPlateau (and it is a task to write them), in Pytorch you can experiment like crazy. If you know how to write Python you are going to get along just fine Want to change the structure of your model between the epochs. Yeah you can do it. Changing the input size for convolution networks on the fly. And much more. It is only your imagination that will stop you.  Wanna Run it Yourself?   So another small confession here. The code above will not run as is as there are some code artifacts which I have not shown here. I did this in favor of making the post more readable. Like you see the seed_everything, MyDataset and CyclicLR (From Jeremy Howard Course) functions and classes in the code above which are not really included with Pytorch. But fret not my friend. I have tried to write a Kaggle Kernel with the whole running code. You can see the code here and include it in your projects.
If you liked this post, please don&amp;rsquo;t forget to upvote the Kernel too. I will be obliged.

        <![CDATA[  With the problem of Image Classification is more or less solved by Deep learning, Text Classification is the next new developing theme in deep learning. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Text classification is a common task in natural language processing, which transforms a sequence of text of indefinite length into a category of text. How could you use that?
 To find sentiment of a review. Find toxic comments in a platform like Facebook Find Insincere questions on Quora. A current ongoing competition on kaggle Find fake reviews on websites Will a text advert get clicked or not  And much more. The whole internet is filled with text and to categorise that information algorithmically will only give us incremental benefits to say the least in the field of AI.
Here I am going to use the data from Quora&amp;rsquo;s Insincere questions to talk about the different models that people are building and sharing to perform this task. Obviously these standalone models are not going to put you on the top of the leaderboard, yet I hope that this ensuing discussion would be helpful for people who want to learn more about text classification. This is going to be a long post in that regard.
As a side note: if you want to know more about NLP, I would like to recommend this awesome course on Natural Language Processing in the Advanced machine learning specialization. You can start for free with the 7-day Free Trial. This course covers a wide range of tasks in Natural Language Processing from basic to advanced: sentiment analysis, summarization, dialogue state tracking, to name a few.
Also take a look at my other post: Text Preprocessing Methods for Deep Learning, which talks about different preprocessing techniques you can use for your NLP task and how to switch from Keras to Pytorch.
So let me try to go through some of the models which people are using to perform text classification and try to provide a brief intuition for them.
1. TextCNN: The idea of using a CNN to classify text was first presented in the paper Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification by Yoon Kim. Instead of image pixels, the input to the tasks are sentences or documents represented as a matrix. Each row of the matrix corresponds to one word vector. That is, each row is word-vector that represents a word. Thus a sequence of max length 70 gives us a image of 70(max sequence length)x300(embedding size)
  Now for some intuition. While for a image we move our conv filter horizontally also since here we have fixed our kernel size to filter_size x embed_size i.e. (3,300) we are just going to move down for the convolution taking look at three words at once since our filter size is 3 in this case.Also one can think of filter sizes as unigrams, bigrams, trigrams etc. Since we are looking at a context window of 1,2,3, and 5 words respectively. Here is the text classification network coded in Keras:
# https://www.kaggle.com/yekenot/2dcnn-textclassifier def model_cnn(embedding_matrix): filter_sizes = [1,2,3,5] num_filters = 36 inp = Input(shape=(maxlen,)) x = Embedding(max_features, embed_size, weights=[embedding_matrix])(inp) x = Reshape((maxlen, embed_size, 1))(x) maxpool_pool = [] for i in range(len(filter_sizes)): conv = Conv2D(num_filters, kernel_size=(filter_sizes[i], embed_size), kernel_initializer=&amp;#39;he_normal&amp;#39;, activation=&amp;#39;elu&amp;#39;)(x) maxpool_pool.append(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(maxlen - filter_sizes[i] &#43; 1, 1))(conv)) z = Concatenate(axis=1)(maxpool_pool) z = Flatten()(z) z = Dropout(0.1)(z) outp = Dense(1, activation=&amp;#34;sigmoid&amp;#34;)(z) model = Model(inputs=inp, outputs=outp) model.compile(loss=&amp;#39;binary_crossentropy&amp;#39;, optimizer=&amp;#39;adam&amp;#39;, metrics=[&amp;#39;accuracy&amp;#39;]) return model I have written a simplified and well commented code to run this network(taking input from a lot of other kernels) on a kaggle kernel for this competition. Do take a look there to learn the preprocessing steps, and the word to vec embeddings usage in this model. You will learn something. Please do upvote the kernel if you find it helpful. This kernel scored around 0.661 on the public leaderboard.
2. BiDirectional RNN(LSTM/GRU): TextCNN takes care of a lot of things. For example it takes care of words in close range. It is able to see &amp;ldquo;new york&amp;rdquo; together. But it still can&amp;rsquo;t take care of all the context provided in a particular text sequence. It still does not learn the seem to learn the sequential structure of the data, where every word is dependednt on the previous word. Or a word in the previous sentence.
RNN help us with that. They are able to remember previous information using hidden states and connect it to the current task.
Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) are a subclass of RNN, specialized in remembering information for a long period of time. More over the Bidirectional LSTM keeps the contextual information in both directions which is pretty useful in text classification task (But won&amp;rsquo;t work for a time sweries prediction task).
  For a most simplistic explanation of Bidirectional RNN, think of RNN cell as taking as input a hidden state(a vector) and the word vector and giving out an output vector and the next hidden state.
 Hidden state, Word vector -&amp;gt;(RNN Cell) -&amp;gt; Output Vector , Next Hidden state  For a sequence of length 4 like &amp;lsquo;you will never believe&amp;rsquo;, The RNN cell will give 4 output vectors. Which can be concatenated and then used as part of a dense feedforward architecture.
In the Bidirectional RNN the only change is that we read the text in the normal fashion as well in reverse. So we stack two RNNs in parallel and hence we get 8 output vectors to append.
Once we get the output vectors we send them through a series of dense layers and finally a softmax layer to build a text classifier.
Due to the limitations of RNNs like not remembering long term dependencies, in practice we almost always use LSTM/GRU to model long term dependencies. In such a case you can just think of the RNN cell being replaced by a LSTM cell or a GRU cell in the above figure. An example model is provided below. You can use CuDNNGRU interchangably with CuDNNLSTM, when you build models.
# BiDirectional LSTM def model_lstm_du(embedding_matrix): inp = Input(shape=(maxlen,)) x = Embedding(max_features, embed_size, weights=[embedding_matrix])(inp) &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Here 64 is the size(dim) of the hidden state vector as well as the output vector. Keeping return_sequence we want the output for the entire sequence. So what is the dimension of output for this layer? 64*70(maxlen)*2(bidirection concat) CuDNNLSTM is fast implementation of LSTM layer in Keras which only runs on GPU &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; x = Bidirectional(CuDNNLSTM(64, return_sequences=True))(x) avg_pool = GlobalAveragePooling1D()(x) max_pool = GlobalMaxPooling1D()(x) conc = concatenate([avg_pool, max_pool]) conc = Dense(64, activation=&amp;#34;relu&amp;#34;)(conc) conc = Dropout(0.1)(conc) outp = Dense(1, activation=&amp;#34;sigmoid&amp;#34;)(conc) model = Model(inputs=inp, outputs=outp) model.compile(loss=&amp;#39;binary_crossentropy&amp;#39;, optimizer=&amp;#39;adam&amp;#39;, metrics=[&amp;#39;accuracy&amp;#39;]) return model I have written a simplified and well commented code to run this network(taking input from a lot of other kernels) on a kaggle kernel for this competition. Do take a look there to learn the preprocessing steps, and the word to vec embeddings usage in this model. You will learn something. Please do upvote the kernel if you find it helpful. This kernel scored around 0.671 on the public leaderboard.
3. Attention Models The concept of Attention is relatively new as it comes from Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification paper written jointly by CMU and Microsoft guys in 2016.
So in the past we used to find features from text by doing a keyword extraction. Some word are more helpful in determining the category of a text than others. But in this method we sort of lost the sequential structure of text. With LSTM and deep learning methods while we are able to take case of the sequence structure we lose the ability to give higher weightage to more important words. Can we have the best of both worlds?
And that is attention for you. In the author&amp;rsquo;s words:
 Not all words contribute equally to the representation of the sentence meaning. Hence, we introduce attention mechanism to extract such words that are important to the meaning of the sentence and aggregate the representation of those informative words to form a sentence vector
   In essense we want to create scores for every word in the text, which are the attention similarity score for a word.
To do this we start with a weight matrix(W), a bias vector(b) and a context vector u. All of them will be learned by the optimmization algorithm.
Then there are a series of mathematical operations. See the figure for more clarification. We can think of u1 as non linearity on RNN word output. After that v1 is a dot product of u1 with a context vector u raised to an exponentiation. From an intuition viewpoint, the value of v1 will be high if u and u1 are similar. Since we want the sum of scores to be 1, we divide v by the sum of v’s to get the Final Scores,s
These final scores are then multiplied by RNN output for words to weight them according to their importance. After which the outputs are summed and sent through dense layers and softmax for the task of text classification.
def dot_product(x, kernel): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; Wrapper for dot product operation, in order to be compatible with both Theano and Tensorflow Args: x (): input kernel (): weights Returns: &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; if K.backend() == &amp;#39;tensorflow&amp;#39;: return K.squeeze(K.dot(x, K.expand_dims(kernel)), axis=-1) else: return K.dot(x, kernel) class AttentionWithContext(Layer): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; Attention operation, with a context/query vector, for temporal data. Supports Masking. Follows the work of Yang et al. [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf] &amp;#34;Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification&amp;#34; by using a context vector to assist the attention # Input shape 3D tensor with shape: `(samples, steps, features)`. # Output shape 2D tensor with shape: `(samples, features)`. How to use: Just put it on top of an RNN Layer (GRU/LSTM/SimpleRNN) with return_sequences=True. The dimensions are inferred based on the output shape of the RNN. Note: The layer has been tested with Keras 2.0.6 Example: model.add(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)) model.add(AttentionWithContext()) # next add a Dense layer (for classification/regression) or whatever... &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; def __init__(self, W_regularizer=None, u_regularizer=None, b_regularizer=None, W_constraint=None, u_constraint=None, b_constraint=None, bias=True, **kwargs): self.supports_masking = True self.init = initializers.get(&amp;#39;glorot_uniform&amp;#39;) self.W_regularizer = regularizers.get(W_regularizer) self.u_regularizer = regularizers.get(u_regularizer) self.b_regularizer = regularizers.get(b_regularizer) self.W_constraint = constraints.get(W_constraint) self.u_constraint = constraints.get(u_constraint) self.b_constraint = constraints.get(b_constraint) self.bias = bias super(AttentionWithContext, self).__init__(**kwargs) def build(self, input_shape): assert len(input_shape) == 3 self.W = self.add_weight((input_shape[-1], input_shape[-1],), initializer=self.init, name=&amp;#39;{}_W&amp;#39;.format(self.name), regularizer=self.W_regularizer, constraint=self.W_constraint) if self.bias: self.b = self.add_weight((input_shape[-1],), initializer=&amp;#39;zero&amp;#39;, name=&amp;#39;{}_b&amp;#39;.format(self.name), regularizer=self.b_regularizer, constraint=self.b_constraint) self.u = self.add_weight((input_shape[-1],), initializer=self.init, name=&amp;#39;{}_u&amp;#39;.format(self.name), regularizer=self.u_regularizer, constraint=self.u_constraint) super(AttentionWithContext, self).build(input_shape) def compute_mask(self, input, input_mask=None): # do not pass the mask to the next layers return None def call(self, x, mask=None): uit = dot_product(x, self.W) if self.bias: uit &#43;= self.b uit = K.tanh(uit) ait = dot_product(uit, self.u) a = K.exp(ait) # apply mask after the exp. will be re-normalized next if mask is not None: # Cast the mask to floatX to avoid float64 upcasting in theano a *= K.cast(mask, K.floatx()) # in some cases especially in the early stages of training the sum may be almost zero # and this results in NaN&amp;#39;s. A workaround is to add a very small positive number ε to the sum. # a /= K.cast(K.sum(a, axis=1, keepdims=True), K.floatx()) a /= K.cast(K.sum(a, axis=1, keepdims=True) &#43; K.epsilon(), K.floatx()) a = K.expand_dims(a) weighted_input = x * a return K.sum(weighted_input, axis=1) def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape): return input_shape[0], input_shape[-1] def model_lstm_atten(embedding_matrix): inp = Input(shape=(maxlen,)) x = Embedding(max_features, embed_size, weights=[embedding_matrix], trainable=False)(inp) x = Bidirectional(CuDNNLSTM(128, return_sequences=True))(x) x = Bidirectional(CuDNNLSTM(64, return_sequences=True))(x) x = AttentionWithContext()(x) x = Dense(64, activation=&amp;#34;relu&amp;#34;)(x) x = Dense(1, activation=&amp;#34;sigmoid&amp;#34;)(x) model = Model(inputs=inp, outputs=x) model.compile(loss=&amp;#39;binary_crossentropy&amp;#39;, optimizer=&amp;#39;adam&amp;#39;, metrics=[&amp;#39;accuracy&amp;#39;]) return model I have written a simplified and well commented code to run this network(taking input from a lot of other kernels) on a kaggle kernel for this competition. Do take a look there to learn the preprocessing steps, and the word to vec embeddings usage in this model. You will learn something. Please do upvote the kernel if you find it helpful. This kernel scored around 0.682 on the public leaderboard.

        <![CDATA[  Graphs provide us with a very useful data structure. They can help us to find structure within our data. With the advent of Machine learning and big data we need to get as much information as possible about our data. Learning a little bit of graph theory can certainly help us with that.
Here is a Graph Analytics for Big Data course on Coursera by UCSanDiego which I highly recommend to learn the basics of graph theory. You can start for free with the 7-day Free Trial.
One of the algorithms I am going to focus in the current post is called Connected Components. Why it is important. We all know clustering.
You can think of Connected Components in very layman&amp;rsquo;s terms as sort of a hard clustering algorithm which finds clusters/islands in related/connected data. As a concrete example: Say you have data about roads joining any two cities in the world. And you need to find out all the continents in the world and which city they contain.
How will you achieve that? Come on give some thought.
To put a Retail Perspective: Lets say, we have a lot of customers using a lot of accounts. One way in which we can use the Connected components algorithm is to find out distinct families in our dataset. We can assume edges(roads) between CustomerIDs based on same credit card usage, or same address or same mobile number etc. Once we have those connections, we can then run the connected component algorithm on the same to create individual clusters to which we can then assign a family ID. We can use these family IDs to provide personalized recommendations based on a family needs. We can also use this family ID to fuel our classification algorithms by creating grouped features based on family.
In Finance Perspective: Another use case would be to capture fraud using these family IDs. If an account has done fraud in past, it is highly probable that the connected accounts are also susceptible to fraud.
So enough of use cases. Lets start with a simple graph class written in Python to start up our exploits with code.
This post will revolve more around code from here onwards.
&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; A Python Class A simple Python graph class, demonstrating the essential facts and functionalities of graphs. Taken from https://www.python-course.eu/graphs_python.php Changed the implementation a little bit to include weighted edges &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; class Graph(object): def __init__(self, graph_dict=None): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; initializes a graph object If no dictionary or None is given, an empty dictionary will be used &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; if graph_dict == None: graph_dict = {} self.__graph_dict = graph_dict def vertices(self): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; returns the vertices of a graph &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; return list(self.__graph_dict.keys()) def edges(self): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; returns the edges of a graph &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; return self.__generate_edges() def add_vertex(self, vertex): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; If the vertex &amp;#34;vertex&amp;#34; is not in self.__graph_dict, a key &amp;#34;vertex&amp;#34; with an empty dict as a value is added to the dictionary. Otherwise nothing has to be done. &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; if vertex not in self.__graph_dict: self.__graph_dict[vertex] = {} def add_edge(self, edge,weight=1): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; assumes that edge is of type set, tuple or list &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; edge = set(edge) (vertex1, vertex2) = tuple(edge) if vertex1 in self.__graph_dict: self.__graph_dict[vertex1][vertex2] = weight else: self.__graph_dict[vertex1] = {vertex2:weight} if vertex2 in self.__graph_dict: self.__graph_dict[vertex2][vertex1] = weight else: self.__graph_dict[vertex2] = {vertex1:weight} def __generate_edges(self): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; A static method generating the edges of the graph &amp;#34;graph&amp;#34;. Edges are represented as sets with one (a loop back to the vertex) or two vertices &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; edges = [] for vertex in self.__graph_dict: for neighbour,weight in self.__graph_dict[vertex].iteritems(): if (neighbour, vertex, weight) not in edges: edges.append([vertex, neighbour, weight]) return edges def __str__(self): res = &amp;#34;vertices: &amp;#34; for k in self.__graph_dict: res &#43;= str(k) &#43; &amp;#34; &amp;#34; res &#43;= &amp;#34;\nedges: &amp;#34; for edge in self.__generate_edges(): res &#43;= str(edge) &#43; &amp;#34; &amp;#34; return res def adj_mat(self): return self.__graph_dict You can certainly play with our new graph class.Here we try to build some graphs.
g = { &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; : {&amp;#34;d&amp;#34;:2}, &amp;#34;b&amp;#34; : {&amp;#34;c&amp;#34;:2}, &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; : {&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;:5, &amp;#34;d&amp;#34;:3, &amp;#34;e&amp;#34;:5} } graph = Graph(g) print(&amp;#34;Vertices of graph:&amp;#34;) print(graph.vertices()) print(&amp;#34;Edges of graph:&amp;#34;) print(graph.edges()) print(&amp;#34;Add vertex:&amp;#34;) graph.add_vertex(&amp;#34;z&amp;#34;) print(&amp;#34;Vertices of graph:&amp;#34;) print(graph.vertices()) print(&amp;#34;Add an edge:&amp;#34;) graph.add_edge({&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;z&amp;#34;}) print(&amp;#34;Vertices of graph:&amp;#34;) print(graph.vertices()) print(&amp;#34;Edges of graph:&amp;#34;) print(graph.edges()) print(&amp;#39;Adding an edge {&amp;#34;x&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;y&amp;#34;} with new vertices:&amp;#39;) graph.add_edge({&amp;#34;x&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;y&amp;#34;}) print(&amp;#34;Vertices of graph:&amp;#34;) print(graph.vertices()) print(&amp;#34;Edges of graph:&amp;#34;) print(graph.edges()) Vertices of graph: [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;b&#39;] Edges of graph: [[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, 2], [&#39;c&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, 5], [&#39;c&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, 5], [&#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, 3], [&#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, 2]] Add vertex: Vertices of graph: [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;z&#39;] Add an edge: Vertices of graph: [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;z&#39;] Edges of graph: [[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;z&#39;, 1], [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, 2], [&#39;c&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, 5], [&#39;c&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, 5], [&#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, 3], [&#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, 2], [&#39;z&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, 1]] Adding an edge {&#34;x&#34;,&#34;y&#34;} with new vertices: Vertices of graph: [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;z&#39;] Edges of graph: [[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;z&#39;, 1], [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, 2], [&#39;c&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, 5], [&#39;c&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, 5], [&#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, 3], [&#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, 2], [&#39;y&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, 1], [&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, 1], [&#39;z&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, 1]]  Lets do something interesting now.
We will use the above graph class for our understanding purpose. There are many Modules in python which we can use to do whatever I am going to do next,but to understand the methods we will write everything from scratch. Lets start with an example graph which we can use for our purpose.
  g = {&amp;#39;Frankfurt&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;Mannheim&amp;#39;:85, &amp;#39;Wurzburg&amp;#39;:217, &amp;#39;Kassel&amp;#39;:173}, &amp;#39;Mannheim&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;Frankfurt&amp;#39;:85, &amp;#39;Karlsruhe&amp;#39;:80}, &amp;#39;Karlsruhe&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;Augsburg&amp;#39;:250, &amp;#39;Mannheim&amp;#39;:80}, &amp;#39;Augsburg&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;Karlsruhe&amp;#39;:250, &amp;#39;Munchen&amp;#39;:84}, &amp;#39;Wurzburg&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;Erfurt&amp;#39;:186, &amp;#39;Numberg&amp;#39;:103,&amp;#39;Frankfurt&amp;#39;:217}, &amp;#39;Erfurt&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;Wurzburg&amp;#39;:186}, &amp;#39;Numberg&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;Wurzburg&amp;#39;:103, &amp;#39;Stuttgart&amp;#39;:183,&amp;#39;Munchen&amp;#39;:167}, &amp;#39;Munchen&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;Numberg&amp;#39;:167, &amp;#39;Augsburg&amp;#39;:84,&amp;#39;Kassel&amp;#39;:502}, &amp;#39;Kassel&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;Frankfurt&amp;#39;:173, &amp;#39;Munchen&amp;#39;:502}, &amp;#39;Stuttgart&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;Numberg&amp;#39;:183} } graph = Graph(g) print(&amp;#34;Vertices of graph:&amp;#34;) print(graph.vertices()) print(&amp;#34;Edges of graph:&amp;#34;) print(graph.edges()) Vertices of graph: [&#39;Mannheim&#39;, &#39;Erfurt&#39;, &#39;Munchen&#39;, &#39;Numberg&#39;, &#39;Stuttgart&#39;, &#39;Augsburg&#39;, &#39;Kassel&#39;, &#39;Frankfurt&#39;, &#39;Wurzburg&#39;, &#39;Karlsruhe&#39;] Edges of graph: [[&#39;Mannheim&#39;, &#39;Frankfurt&#39;, 85], [&#39;Mannheim&#39;, &#39;Karlsruhe&#39;, 80], [&#39;Erfurt&#39;, &#39;Wurzburg&#39;, 186], [&#39;Munchen&#39;, &#39;Numberg&#39;, 167], [&#39;Munchen&#39;, &#39;Augsburg&#39;, 84], [&#39;Munchen&#39;, &#39;Kassel&#39;, 502], [&#39;Numberg&#39;, &#39;Stuttgart&#39;, 183], [&#39;Numberg&#39;, &#39;Wurzburg&#39;, 103], [&#39;Numberg&#39;, &#39;Munchen&#39;, 167], [&#39;Stuttgart&#39;, &#39;Numberg&#39;, 183], [&#39;Augsburg&#39;, &#39;Munchen&#39;, 84], [&#39;Augsburg&#39;, &#39;Karlsruhe&#39;, 250], [&#39;Kassel&#39;, &#39;Munchen&#39;, 502], [&#39;Kassel&#39;, &#39;Frankfurt&#39;, 173], [&#39;Frankfurt&#39;, &#39;Mannheim&#39;, 85], [&#39;Frankfurt&#39;, &#39;Wurzburg&#39;, 217], [&#39;Frankfurt&#39;, &#39;Kassel&#39;, 173], [&#39;Wurzburg&#39;, &#39;Numberg&#39;, 103], [&#39;Wurzburg&#39;, &#39;Erfurt&#39;, 186], [&#39;Wurzburg&#39;, &#39;Frankfurt&#39;, 217], [&#39;Karlsruhe&#39;, &#39;Mannheim&#39;, 80], [&#39;Karlsruhe&#39;, &#39;Augsburg&#39;, 250]]  Lets say we are given a graph with the cities of Germany and respective distance between them. You want to find out how to go from Frankfurt (The starting node) to Munchen. There might be many ways in which you can traverse the graph but you need to find how many cities you will need to visit on a minimum to go from frankfurt to Munchen) This problem is analogous to finding out distance between nodes in an unweighted graph.
The algorithm that we use here is called as Breadth First Search.
def min_num_edges_between_nodes(graph,start_node): distance = 0 shortest_path = [] queue = [start_node] #FIFO levels = {} levels[start_node] = 0 shortest_paths = {} shortest_paths[start_node] = &amp;#34;:&amp;#34; visited = [start_node] while len(queue)!=0: start = queue.pop(0) neighbours = graph[start] for neighbour,_ in neighbours.iteritems(): if neighbour not in visited: queue.append(neighbour) visited.append(neighbour) levels[neighbour] = levels[start]&#43;1 shortest_paths[neighbour] = shortest_paths[start] &#43;&amp;#34;-&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&#43; start return levels, shortest_paths What we do in the above piece of code is create a queue and traverse it based on levels. We start with Frankfurt as starting node. We loop through its neighbouring cities(Menheim, Wurzburg and Kassel) and push them into the queue. We keep track of what level they are at and also the path through which we reached them. Since we are popping a first element of a queue we are sure we will visit cities in the order of their level.
Checkout this good post about BFS to understand more about queues and BFS.
min_num_edges_between_nodes(g,&amp;#39;Frankfurt&amp;#39;) ({&#39;Augsburg&#39;: 3, &#39;Erfurt&#39;: 2, &#39;Frankfurt&#39;: 0, &#39;Karlsruhe&#39;: 2, &#39;Kassel&#39;: 1, &#39;Mannheim&#39;: 1, &#39;Munchen&#39;: 2, &#39;Numberg&#39;: 2, &#39;Stuttgart&#39;: 3, &#39;Wurzburg&#39;: 1}, {&#39;Augsburg&#39;: &#39;:-Frankfurt-Mannheim-Karlsruhe&#39;, &#39;Erfurt&#39;: &#39;:-Frankfurt-Wurzburg&#39;, &#39;Frankfurt&#39;: &#39;:&#39;, &#39;Karlsruhe&#39;: &#39;:-Frankfurt-Mannheim&#39;, &#39;Kassel&#39;: &#39;:-Frankfurt&#39;, &#39;Mannheim&#39;: &#39;:-Frankfurt&#39;, &#39;Munchen&#39;: &#39;:-Frankfurt-Kassel&#39;, &#39;Numberg&#39;: &#39;:-Frankfurt-Wurzburg&#39;, &#39;Stuttgart&#39;: &#39;:-Frankfurt-Wurzburg-Numberg&#39;, &#39;Wurzburg&#39;: &#39;:-Frankfurt&#39;})  I did this example to show how BFS algorithm works. We can extend this algorithm to find out connected components in an unconnected graph. Lets say we need to find groups of unconnected vertices in the graph.
For example: the below graph has 3 unconnected sub-graphs. Can we find what nodes belong to a particular subgraph?
  #We add another countries in the loop  graph = Graph(g) graph.add_edge((&amp;#34;Mumbai&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Delhi&amp;#34;),400) graph.add_edge((&amp;#34;Delhi&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Kolkata&amp;#34;),500) graph.add_edge((&amp;#34;Kolkata&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Bangalore&amp;#34;),600) graph.add_edge((&amp;#34;TX&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;NY&amp;#34;),1200) graph.add_edge((&amp;#34;ALB&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;NY&amp;#34;),800) g = graph.adj_mat() def bfs_connected_components(graph): connected_components = [] nodes = graph.keys() while len(nodes)!=0: start_node = nodes.pop() queue = [start_node] #FIFO visited = [start_node] while len(queue)!=0: start = queue[0] queue.remove(start) neighbours = graph[start] for neighbour,_ in neighbours.iteritems(): if neighbour not in visited: queue.append(neighbour) visited.append(neighbour) nodes.remove(neighbour) connected_components.append(visited) return connected_components print bfs_connected_components(g) The above code is similar to the previous BFS code. We keep all the vertices of the graph in the nodes list. We take a node from the nodes list and start BFS on it. as we visit a node we remove that node from the nodes list. Whenever the BFS completes we start again with another node in the nodes list until the nodes list is empty.
[[&#39;Kassel&#39;, &#39;Munchen&#39;, &#39;Frankfurt&#39;, &#39;Numberg&#39;, &#39;Augsburg&#39;, &#39;Mannheim&#39;, &#39;Wurzburg&#39;, &#39;Stuttgart&#39;, &#39;Karlsruhe&#39;, &#39;Erfurt&#39;], [&#39;Bangalore&#39;, &#39;Kolkata&#39;, &#39;Delhi&#39;, &#39;Mumbai&#39;], [&#39;NY&#39;, &#39;ALB&#39;, &#39;TX&#39;]]  As you can see we are able to find distinct components in our data. Just by using Edges and Vertices. This algorithm could be run on different data to satisfy any use case I presented above.
But Normally using Connected Components for a retail case will involve a lot of data and you will need to scale this algorithm.
Connected Components in PySpark Below is an implementation from this paper on Connected Components in MapReduce and Beyond from Google Research. Read the PPT to understand the implementation better. Some ready to use code for you.
def create_edges(line): a = [int(x) for x in line.split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;)] edges_list=[] for i in range(0, len(a)-1): for j in range(i&#43;1 ,len(a)): edges_list.append((a[i],a[j])) edges_list.append((a[j],a[i])) return edges_list # adj_list.txt is a txt file containing adjacency list of the graph. adjacency_list = sc.textFile(&amp;#34;adj_list.txt&amp;#34;) edges_rdd = adjacency_list.flatMap(lambda line : create_edges(line)).distinct() def largeStarInit(record): a, b = record yield (a,b) yield (b,a) def largeStar(record): a, b = record t_list = list(b) t_list.append(a) list_min = min(t_list) for x in b: if a &amp;lt; x: yield (x,list_min) def smallStarInit(record): a, b = record if b&amp;lt;=a: yield (a,b) else: yield (b,a) def smallStar(record): a, b = record t_list = list(b) t_list.append(a) list_min = min(t_list) for x in t_list: if x!=list_min: yield (x,list_min) #Handle case for single nodes def single_vertex(line): a = [int(x) for x in line.split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;)] edges_list=[] if len(a)==1: edges_list.append((a[0],a[0])) return edges_list iteration_num =0 while 1==1: if iteration_num==0: print &amp;#34;iter&amp;#34;, iteration_num large_star_rdd = edges_rdd.groupByKey().flatMap(lambda x : largeStar(x)) small_star_rdd = large_star_rdd.flatMap(lambda x : smallStarInit(x)).groupByKey().flatMap(lambda x : smallStar(x)).distinct() iteration_num &#43;= 1 else: print &amp;#34;iter&amp;#34;, iteration_num large_star_rdd = small_star_rdd.flatMap(lambda x: largeStarInit(x)).groupByKey().flatMap(lambda x : largeStar(x)).distinct() small_star_rdd = large_star_rdd.flatMap(lambda x : smallStarInit(x)).groupByKey().flatMap(lambda x : smallStar(x)).distinct() iteration_num &#43;= 1 #check Convergence changes = (large_star_rdd.subtract(small_star_rdd).union(small_star_rdd.subtract(large_star_rdd))).collect() if len(changes) == 0 : break single_vertex_rdd = adjacency_list.flatMap(lambda line : single_vertex(line)).distinct() answer = single_vertex_rdd.collect() &#43; large_star_rdd.collect() print answer[:10] Or Use GraphFrames in PySpark To Install graphframes:
I ran on command line: pyspark &amp;ndash;packages graphframes:graphframes:0.5.0-spark2.1-s_2.11 which opened up my notebook and installed graphframes after i try to import in my notebook.
The string to be formatted as : graphframes:(latest version)-spark(your spark version)-s_(your scala version).
Checkout this guide on how to use GraphFrames for more information.
from graphframes import * def vertices(line): vert = [int(x) for x in line.split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;)] return vert vertices = adjacency_list.flatMap(lambda x: vertices(x)).distinct().collect() vertices = sqlContext.createDataFrame([[x] for x in vertices], [&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;]) def create_edges(line): a = [int(x) for x in line.split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;)] edges_list=[] if len(a)==1: edges_list.append((a[0],a[0])) for i in range(0, len(a)-1): for j in range(i&#43;1 ,len(a)): edges_list.append((a[i],a[j])) edges_list.append((a[j],a[i])) return edges_list edges = adjacency_list.flatMap(lambda x: create_edges(x)).distinct().collect() edges = sqlContext.createDataFrame(edges, [&amp;#34;src&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;dst&amp;#34;]) g = GraphFrame(vertices, edges) sc.setCheckpointDir(&amp;#34;.&amp;#34;) # graphframes uses the same paper we referenced apparently cc = g.connectedComponents() print cc.show() The GraphFrames library implements the CC algorithm as well as a variety of other graph algorithms.
The above post was a lot of code but hope it was helpful. It took me a lot of time to implement the algorithm so wanted to make it easy for the folks.

        <![CDATA[  Recently Kaggle master Kazanova along with some of his friends released a &amp;ldquo;How to win a data science competition&amp;rdquo; Coursera course. You can start for free with the 7-day Free Trial. The Course involved a final project which itself was a time series prediction problem. Here I will describe how I got a top 10 position as of writing this article.
  Description of the Problem: In this competition we were given a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company.
We were asked you to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month.
The evaluation metric was RMSE where True target values are clipped into [0,20] range. This target range will be a lot important in understanding the submissions that I will prepare.
The main thing that I noticed was that the data preparation aspect of this competition was by far the most important thing. I creted a variety of features. Here are the steps I took and the features I created.
1. Created a dataframe of all Date_block_num, Store and Item combinations: This is important because in the months we don&amp;rsquo;t have a data for an item store combination, the machine learning algorithm needs to be specifically told that the sales is zero.
from itertools import product # Create &amp;#34;grid&amp;#34; with columns index_cols = [&amp;#39;shop_id&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;item_id&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;] # For every month we create a grid from all shops/items combinations from that month grid = [] for block_num in sales[&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;].unique(): cur_shops = sales.loc[sales[&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;] == block_num, &amp;#39;shop_id&amp;#39;].unique() cur_items = sales.loc[sales[&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;] == block_num, &amp;#39;item_id&amp;#39;].unique() grid.append(np.array(list(product(*[cur_shops, cur_items, [block_num]])),dtype=&amp;#39;int32&amp;#39;)) grid = pd.DataFrame(np.vstack(grid), columns = index_cols,dtype=np.int32) 2. Cleaned up a little of sales data after some basic EDA: sales = sales[sales.item_price&amp;lt;100000] sales = sales[sales.item_cnt_day&amp;lt;=1000] 3. Created Mean Encodings: sales_m = sales.groupby([&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;shop_id&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;item_id&amp;#39;]).agg({&amp;#39;item_cnt_day&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;sum&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;item_price&amp;#39;: np.mean}).reset_index() sales_m = pd.merge(grid,sales_m,on=[&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;shop_id&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;item_id&amp;#39;],how=&amp;#39;left&amp;#39;).fillna(0) # adding the category id too sales_m = pd.merge(sales_m,items,on=[&amp;#39;item_id&amp;#39;],how=&amp;#39;left&amp;#39;) for type_id in [&amp;#39;item_id&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;shop_id&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;item_category_id&amp;#39;]: for column_id,aggregator,aggtype in [(&amp;#39;item_price&amp;#39;,np.mean,&amp;#39;avg&amp;#39;),(&amp;#39;item_cnt_day&amp;#39;,np.sum,&amp;#39;sum&amp;#39;),(&amp;#39;item_cnt_day&amp;#39;,np.mean,&amp;#39;avg&amp;#39;)]: mean_df = sales.groupby([type_id,&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;]).aggregate(aggregator).reset_index()[[column_id,type_id,&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;]] mean_df.columns = [type_id&#43;&amp;#39;_&amp;#39;&#43;aggtype&#43;&amp;#39;_&amp;#39;&#43;column_id,type_id,&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;] sales_m = pd.merge(sales_m,mean_df,on=[&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;,type_id],how=&amp;#39;left&amp;#39;) These above lines add the following 9 features :
 &amp;lsquo;item_id_avg_item_price&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;item_id_sum_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;item_id_avg_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;shop_id_avg_item_price&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;shop_id_sum_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;shop_id_avg_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;item_category_id_avg_item_price&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;item_category_id_sum_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;item_category_id_avg_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo;  4. Create Lag Features: Next we create lag features with diferent lag periods on the following features:
 &amp;lsquo;item_id_avg_item_price&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;item_id_sum_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;item_id_avg_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;shop_id_avg_item_price&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;shop_id_sum_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;shop_id_avg_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;item_category_id_avg_item_price&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;item_category_id_sum_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;item_category_id_avg_item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;item_cnt_day&amp;rsquo;  lag_variables = list(sales_m.columns[7:])&#43;[&amp;#39;item_cnt_day&amp;#39;] lags = [1 ,2 ,3 ,4, 5, 12] for lag in lags: sales_new_df = sales_m.copy() sales_new_df.date_block_num&#43;=lag sales_new_df = sales_new_df[[&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;shop_id&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;item_id&amp;#39;]&#43;lag_variables] sales_new_df.columns = [&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;shop_id&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;item_id&amp;#39;]&#43; [lag_feat&#43;&amp;#39;_lag_&amp;#39;&#43;str(lag) for lag_feat in lag_variables] sales_means = pd.merge(sales_means, sales_new_df,on=[&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;shop_id&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;item_id&amp;#39;] ,how=&amp;#39;left&amp;#39;) 5. Fill NA with zeros: for feat in sales_means.columns: if &amp;#39;item_cnt&amp;#39; in feat: sales_means[feat]=sales_means[feat].fillna(0) elif &amp;#39;item_price&amp;#39; in feat: sales_means[feat]=sales_means[feat].fillna(sales_means[feat].median()) 6. Drop the columns that we are not going to use in training: cols_to_drop = lag_variables[:-1] &#43; [&amp;#39;item_name&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;item_price&amp;#39;] 7. Take a recent bit of data only: sales_means = sales_means[sales_means[&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;]&amp;gt;12] 8. Split in train and CV : X_train = sales_means[sales_means[&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;]&amp;lt;33].drop(cols_to_drop, axis=1) X_cv = sales_means[sales_means[&amp;#39;date_block_num&amp;#39;]==33].drop(cols_to_drop, axis=1) 9. THE MAGIC SAUCE: In the start I told that the clipping aspect of [0,20] will be important. In the next few lines I clipped the days to range[0,40]. You might ask me why 40. An intuitive answer is if I had clipped to range [0,20] there would be very few tree nodes that could give 20 as an answer. While if I increase it to 40 having a 20 becomes much more easier. Please note that We will clip our predictions in the [0,20] range in the end.
def clip(x): if x&amp;gt;40: return 40 elif x&amp;lt;0: return 0 else: return x train[&amp;#39;item_cnt_day&amp;#39;] = train.apply(lambda x: clip(x[&amp;#39;item_cnt_day&amp;#39;]),axis=1) cv[&amp;#39;item_cnt_day&amp;#39;] = cv.apply(lambda x: clip(x[&amp;#39;item_cnt_day&amp;#39;]),axis=1) 10: Modelling:  Created a XGBoost model to get the most important features(Top 42 features) Use hyperopt to tune xgboost Used top 10 models from tuned XGBoosts to generate predictions. clipped the predictions to [0,20] range Final solution was the average of these 10 predictions.  Learned a lot of new things from this awesome course. Most recommended.

        <![CDATA[  Often times it happens that we fall short of creativity. And creativity is one of the basic ingredients of what we do. Creating features needs creativity. So here is the list of ideas I gather in day to day life, where people have used creativity to get great results on Kaggle leaderboards.
Take a look at the How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers course in the Advanced machine learning specialization by Kazanova(Number 3 Kaggler at the time of writing). You can start for free with the 7-day Free Trial.
This post is inspired by a Kernel on Kaggle written by Beluga, one of the top Kagglers, for a knowledge based competition.
Some of the techniques/tricks I am sharing have been taken directly from that kernel so you could take a look yourself. Otherwise stay here and read on.
1. Don&amp;rsquo;t try predicting the future when you don&amp;rsquo;t have to: If both training/test comes from the same timeline, we can get really crafty with features. Although this is a case with Kaggle only, we can use this to our advantage. For example: In the Taxi Trip duration challenge the test data is randomly sampled from the train data. In this case we can use the target variable averaged over different categorical variable as a feature. Like in this case Beluga actually used the averaged the target variable over different weekdays. He then mapped the same averaged value as a variable by mapping it to test data too.
2. logloss clipping Technique: Something that I learned in the Neural Network course by Jeremy Howard. Its based on a very simple Idea. Logloss penalises a lot if we are very confident and wrong. So in case of Classification problems where we have to predict probabilities, it would be much better to clip our probabilities between 0.05-0.95 so that we are never very sure about our prediction.
3. kaggle submission in gzip format: A small piece of code that will help you save countless hours of uploading. Enjoy. df.to_csv(&amp;lsquo;submission.csv.gz&amp;rsquo;, index=False, compression=&amp;lsquo;gzip&amp;rsquo;)
4. How best to use Latitude and Longitude features - Part 1: One of the best things that I liked about the Beluga Kernel is how he used the Lat/Lon Data. So in the example we had pickup Lat/Lon and Dropoff Lat/Lon. We created features like:
A. Haversine Distance Between the Two Lat/Lons: def haversine_array(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2): lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2 = map(np.radians, (lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2)) AVG_EARTH_RADIUS = 6371 # in km lat = lat2 - lat1 lng = lng2 - lng1 d = np.sin(lat * 0.5) ** 2 &#43; np.cos(lat1) * np.cos(lat2) * np.sin(lng * 0.5) ** 2 h = 2 * AVG_EARTH_RADIUS * np.arcsin(np.sqrt(d)) return h B. Manhattan Distance Between the two Lat/Lons: def dummy_manhattan_distance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2): a = haversine_array(lat1, lng1, lat1, lng2) b = haversine_array(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng1) return a &#43; b C. Bearing Between the two Lat/Lons: def bearing_array(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2): AVG_EARTH_RADIUS = 6371 # in km lng_delta_rad = np.radians(lng2 - lng1) lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2 = map(np.radians, (lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2)) y = np.sin(lng_delta_rad) * np.cos(lat2) x = np.cos(lat1) * np.sin(lat2) - np.sin(lat1) * np.cos(lat2) * np.cos(lng_delta_rad) return np.degrees(np.arctan2(y, x)) D. Center Latitude and Longitude between Pickup and Dropoff: train.loc[:, &amp;#39;center_latitude&amp;#39;] = (train[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;].values &#43; train[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;].values) / 2 train.loc[:, &amp;#39;center_longitude&amp;#39;] = (train[&amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;].values &#43; train[&amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;].values) / 2 5. How best to use Latitude and Longitude features - Part 2: The Second way he used the Lat/Lon Feats was to create clusters for Pickup and Dropoff Lat/Lons. The way it worked was it created sort of Boroughs in the data by design.
from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans coords = np.vstack((train[[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;]].values, train[[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;]].values, test[[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;]].values, test[[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;]].values)) sample_ind = np.random.permutation(len(coords))[:500000] kmeans = MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=100, batch_size=10000).fit(coords[sample_ind]) train.loc[:, &amp;#39;pickup_cluster&amp;#39;] = kmeans.predict(train[[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;]]) train.loc[:, &amp;#39;dropoff_cluster&amp;#39;] = kmeans.predict(train[[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;]]) test.loc[:, &amp;#39;pickup_cluster&amp;#39;] = kmeans.predict(test[[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;]]) test.loc[:, &amp;#39;dropoff_cluster&amp;#39;] = kmeans.predict(test[[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;]]) He then used these Clusters to create features like counting no of trips going out and coming in on a particular day.
6. How best to use Latitude and Longitude features - Part 3 He used PCA to transform longitude and latitude coordinates. In this case it is not about dimension reduction since he transformed 2D-&amp;gt; 2D. The rotation could help for decision tree splits, and it did actually.
pca = PCA().fit(coords) train[&amp;#39;pickup_pca0&amp;#39;] = pca.transform(train[[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;]])[:, 0] train[&amp;#39;pickup_pca1&amp;#39;] = pca.transform(train[[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;]])[:, 1] train[&amp;#39;dropoff_pca0&amp;#39;] = pca.transform(train[[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;]])[:, 0] train[&amp;#39;dropoff_pca1&amp;#39;] = pca.transform(train[[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;]])[:, 1] test[&amp;#39;pickup_pca0&amp;#39;] = pca.transform(test[[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;]])[:, 0] test[&amp;#39;pickup_pca1&amp;#39;] = pca.transform(test[[&amp;#39;pickup_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;pickup_longitude&amp;#39;]])[:, 1] test[&amp;#39;dropoff_pca0&amp;#39;] = pca.transform(test[[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;]])[:, 0] test[&amp;#39;dropoff_pca1&amp;#39;] = pca.transform(test[[&amp;#39;dropoff_latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;dropoff_longitude&amp;#39;]])[:, 1] 7. Lets not forget the Normal Things you can do with your features:  Scaling by Max-Min Normalization using Standard Deviation Log based feature/Target: use log based features or log based target function. One Hot Encoding  8. Creating Intuitive Additional Features: A) Date time Features: Time based Features like &amp;ldquo;Evening&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Noon&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Night&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Purchases_last_month&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Purchases_last_week&amp;rdquo; etc.
B) Thought Features: Suppose you have shopping cart data and you want to categorize TripType (See Walmart Recruiting: Trip Type Classification on Kaggle for some background).
You could think of creating a feature like &amp;ldquo;Stylish&amp;rdquo; where you create this variable by adding together number of items that belong to category Men&amp;rsquo;s Fashion, Women&amp;rsquo;s Fashion, Teens Fashion.
You could create a feature like &amp;ldquo;Rare&amp;rdquo; which is created by tagging some items as rare, based on the data we have and then counting the number of those rare items in the shopping cart. Such features might work or might not work. From what I have observed they normally provide a lot of value.
I feel this is the way that Target&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Pregnant Teen model&amp;rdquo; was made. They would have had a variable in which they kept all the items that a pregnant teen could buy and put it into a classification algorithm.
9 . The not so Normal Things which people do: These features are highly unintuitive and should not be created where the machine learning model needs to be interpretable.
A) Interaction Features: If you have features A and B create features A*B, A&#43;B, A/B, A-B. This explodes the feature space. If you have 10 features and you are creating two variable interactions you will be adding 10C2 * 4 features = 180 features to your model. And most of us have a lot more than 10 features.
B) Bucket Feature Using Hashing: Suppose you have a lot of features. In the order of Thousands but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use all the thousand features because of the training times of algorithms involved. People bucket their features using some hashing algorithm to achieve this.Mostly done for text classification tasks. For example: If we have 6 features A,B,C,D,E,F. And the row of data is: A:1,B:1,C:1,D:0,E:1,F:0 I may decide to use a hashing function so that these 6 features correspond to 3 buckets and create the data using this feature hashing vector. After processing my data might look like: Bucket1:2,Bucket2:2,Bucket3:0 Which happened because A and B fell in bucket1, C and E fell in bucket2 and D and F fell in bucket 3. I summed up the observations here, but you could substitute addition with any math function you like. Now i would use Bucket1,Bucket2,Bucket3 as my variables for machine learning.
Will try to keep on expanding. Wait for more&amp;hellip;.

        <![CDATA[  Newton once said that &amp;ldquo;God does not play dice with the universe&amp;rdquo;. But actually he does. Everything happening around us could be explained in terms of probabilities. We repeatedly watch things around us happen due to chances, yet we never learn. We always get dumbfounded by the playfulness of nature.
One of such ways intuition plays with us is with the Birthday problem.
Problem Statement: In a room full of N people, what is the probability that 2 or more people share the same birthday(Assumption: 365 days in year)?
By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 366 (since there are only 365 possible birthdays).
However, the paradox is that 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability is reached with just 23 people.
Mathematical Proof: Sometimes a good strategy when trying to find out probability of an event is to look at the probability of the complement event.Here it is easier to find the probability of the complement event. We just need to count the number of cases in which no person has the same birthday.(Sampling without replacement) Since there are k ways in which birthdays can be chosen with replacement.
$P(birthday Match) = 1 - \dfrac{(365).364&amp;hellip;(365−k&#43;1)}{365^k}$
Simulation: Lets try to build around this result some more by trying to simulate this result:
%matplotlib inline import matplotlib import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #sets up plotting under plt import seaborn as sns #sets up styles and gives us more plotting options import pandas as pd #lets us handle data as dataframes import random def sim_bithday_problem(num_people_room, trials =1000): &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;This function takes as input the number of people in the room. Runs 1000 trials by default and returns (number of times same brthday found)/(no of trials) &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; same_birthdays_found = 0 for i in range(trials): # randomly sample from the birthday space which could be any of a number from 1 to 365 birthdays = [random.randint(1,365) for x in range(num_people_room)] if len(birthdays) - len(set(birthdays))&amp;gt;0: same_birthdays_found&#43;=1 return same_birthdays_found/float(trials) num_people = range(2,100) probs = [sim_bithday_problem(i) for i in num_people] data = pd.DataFrame() data[&amp;#39;num_peeps&amp;#39;] = num_people data[&amp;#39;probs&amp;#39;] = probs sns.set(style=&amp;#34;ticks&amp;#34;) g = sns.regplot(x=&amp;#34;num_peeps&amp;#34;, y=&amp;#34;probs&amp;#34;, data=data, ci = False, scatter_kws={&amp;#34;color&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;darkred&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;alpha&amp;#34;:0.3,&amp;#34;s&amp;#34;:90}, marker=&amp;#34;x&amp;#34;,fit_reg=False) sns.despine() g.figure.set_size_inches(10,6) g.axes.set_title(&amp;#39;As the Number of people in room reaches 23 the probability reaches ~0.5\nAt more than 50 people the probability is reaching 1&amp;#39;, fontsize=15,color=&amp;#34;g&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) g.set_xlabel(&amp;#34;# of people in room&amp;#34;,size = 30,color=&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) g.set_ylabel(&amp;#34;Probability&amp;#34;,size = 30,color=&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) g.tick_params(labelsize=14,labelcolor=&amp;#34;black&amp;#34;)   We can see from the graph that as the Number of people in room reaches 23 the probability reaches ~ 0.5. So we have proved this fact Mathematically as well as with simulation.
Intuition: To understand it we need to think of this problem in terms of pairs. There are ${{23}\choose{2}} = 253$ pairs of people in the room when only 23 people are present. Now with that big number you should not find the probability of 0.5 too much. In the case of 70 people we are looking at ${{70}\choose{2}} = 2450$ pairs.
So thats it for now. To learn more about this go to Wikipedia which has an awesome page on this topic.

        <![CDATA[  Recently Quora put out a Question similarity competition on Kaggle. This is the first time I was attempting an NLP problem so a lot to learn. The one thing that blew my mind away was the word2vec embeddings.
Till now whenever I heard the term word2vec I visualized it as a way to create a bag of words vector for a sentence.
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know bag of words: If we have a series of sentences(documents)
 This is good - [1,1,1,0,0] This is bad - [1,1,0,1,0] This is awesome - [1,1,0,0,1]  Bag of words would encode it using 0:This 1:is 2:good 3:bad 4:awesome
But it is much more powerful than that.
What word2vec does is that it creates vectors for words. What I mean by that is that we have a 300 dimensional vector for every word(common bigrams too) in a dictionary.
How does that help? We can use this for multiple scenarios but the most common are:
A. Using word2vec embeddings we can find out similarity between words. Assume you have to answer if these two statements signify the same thing:
 President greets press in Chicago Obama speaks to media in Illinois.  If we do a sentence similarity metric or a bag of words approach to compare these two sentences we will get a pretty low score.
  But with a word encoding we can say that
 President is similar to Obama greets is similar to speaks press is similar to media Chicago is similar to Illinois  B. Encode Sentences: I read a post from Abhishek Thakur a prominent kaggler.(Must Read). What he did was he used these word embeddings to create a 300 dimensional vector for every sentence.
His Approach: Lets say the sentence is &amp;ldquo;What is this&amp;rdquo; And lets say the embedding for every word is given in 4 dimension(normally 300 dimensional encoding is given)
 what : [.25 ,.25 ,.25 ,.25] is : [ 1 , 0 , 0 , 0] this : [ .5 , 0 , 0 , .5]  Then the vector for the sentence is normalized elementwise addition of the vectors. i.e.
Elementwise addition : [.25&#43;1&#43;0.5, 0.25&#43;0&#43;0 , 0.25&#43;0&#43;0, .25&#43;0&#43;.5] = [1.75, .25, .25, .75] divided by math.sqrt(1.25^2 &#43; .25^2 &#43; .25^2 &#43; .75^2) = 1.5 gives:[1.16, .17, .17, 0.5]  Thus I can convert any sentence to a vector of a fixed dimension(decided by the embedding). To find similarity between two sentences I can use a variety of distance/similarity metrics.
C. Also It enables us to do algebraic manipulations on words which was not possible before. For example: What is king - man &#43; woman ?
Guess what it comes out to be : Queen
Application/Coding: Now lets get down to the coding part as we know a little bit of fundamentals.
First of all we download a custom word embedding from Google. There are many other embeddings too.
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl4j-distribution/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz The above file is pretty big. Might take some time. Then moving on to coding.
from gensim.models import word2vec model = gensim.models.KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(&amp;#39;data/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz&amp;#39;, binary=True) 1. Starting simple, lets find out similar words. Want to find similar words to python? model.most_similar(&amp;#39;python&amp;#39;) [(u&#39;pythons&#39;, 0.6688377261161804),
(u&#39;Burmese_python&#39;, 0.6680364608764648),
(u&#39;snake&#39;, 0.6606293320655823),
(u&#39;crocodile&#39;, 0.6591362953186035),
(u&#39;boa_constrictor&#39;, 0.6443519592285156),
(u&#39;alligator&#39;, 0.6421656608581543),
(u&#39;reptile&#39;, 0.6387745141983032),
(u&#39;albino_python&#39;, 0.6158879995346069),
(u&#39;croc&#39;, 0.6083582639694214),
(u&#39;lizard&#39;, 0.601341724395752)]
 2. Now we can use this model to find the solution to the equation: What is king - man &#43; woman?
model.most_similar(positive = [&amp;#39;king&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;woman&amp;#39;],negative = [&amp;#39;man&amp;#39;]) [(u&#39;queen&#39;, 0.7118192315101624),
(u&#39;monarch&#39;, 0.6189674139022827),
(u&#39;princess&#39;, 0.5902431011199951),
(u&#39;crown_prince&#39;, 0.5499460697174072),
(u&#39;prince&#39;, 0.5377321839332581),
(u&#39;kings&#39;, 0.5236844420433044),
(u&#39;Queen_Consort&#39;, 0.5235946178436279),
(u&#39;queens&#39;, 0.5181134343147278),
(u&#39;sultan&#39;, 0.5098593235015869),
(u&#39;monarchy&#39;, 0.5087412595748901)]
 You can do plenty of freaky/cool things using this:
3. Lets say you wanted a girl and had a girl name like emma in mind but you got a boy. So what is the male version for emma? model.most_similar(positive = [&amp;#39;emma&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;he&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;male&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;mr&amp;#39;],negative = [&amp;#39;she&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;mrs&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;female&amp;#39;]) [(u&#39;sanchez&#39;, 0.4920658469200134),
(u&#39;kenny&#39;, 0.48300960659980774),
(u&#39;alves&#39;, 0.4684845209121704),
(u&#39;gareth&#39;, 0.4530612826347351),
(u&#39;bellamy&#39;, 0.44884198904037476),
(u&#39;gibbs&#39;, 0.445194810628891),
(u&#39;dos_santos&#39;, 0.44508373737335205),
(u&#39;gasol&#39;, 0.44387346506118774),
(u&#39;silva&#39;, 0.4424275755882263),
(u&#39;shaun&#39;, 0.44144102931022644)]
 4. Find which word doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to a list? model.doesnt_match(&amp;#34;math shopping reading science&amp;#34;.split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;)) I think staple doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong in this list!
Other Cool Things 1. Recommendations:   In this paper, the authors have shown that itembased CF can be cast in the same framework of word embedding.
2. Some other examples that people have seen after using their own embeddings: Library - Books = Hall
Obama &#43; Russia - USA = Putin
Iraq - Violence = Jordan
President - Power = Prime Minister (Not in India Though)
3.Seeing the above I started playing with it a little. Is this model sexist?
model.most_similar(positive = [&amp;#34;donald_trump&amp;#34;],negative = [&amp;#39;brain&amp;#39;]) [(u&#39;novak&#39;, 0.40405112504959106),
(u&#39;ozzie&#39;, 0.39440611004829407),
(u&#39;democrate&#39;, 0.39187556505203247),
(u&#39;clinton&#39;, 0.390536367893219),
(u&#39;hillary_clinton&#39;, 0.3862358033657074),
(u&#39;bnp&#39;, 0.38295692205429077),
(u&#39;klaar&#39;, 0.38228923082351685),
(u&#39;geithner&#39;, 0.380607008934021),
(u&#39;bafana_bafana&#39;, 0.3801495432853699),
(u&#39;whitman&#39;, 0.3790769875049591)]
 Whatever it is doing it surely feels like magic. Next time I will try to write more on how it works once I understand it fully.

        <![CDATA[    As a data scientist I believe that a lot of work has to be done before Classification/Regression/Clustering methods are applied to the data you get. The data which may be messy, unwieldy and big. So here are the list of algorithms that helps a data scientist to make better models using the data they have:
1. Sampling Algorithms. In case you want to work with a sample of data.  Simple Random Sampling : Say you want to select a subset of a population in which each member of the subset has an equal probability of being chosen. Stratified Sampling: Assume that we need to estimate average number of votes for each candidate in an election. Assume that country has 3 towns : Town A has 1 million factory workers, Town B has 2 million workers and Town C has 3 million retirees. We can choose to get a random sample of size 60 over entire population but there is some chance that the random sample turns out to be not well balanced across these towns and hence is biased causing a significant error in estimation. Instead if we choose to take a random sample of 10, 20 and 30 from Town A, B and C respectively then we can produce a smaller error in estimation for the same total size of sample. Reservoir Sampling :Say you have a stream of items of large and unknown length that we can only iterate over once. Create an algorithm that randomly chooses an item from this stream such that each item is equally likely to be selected.  2. Map-Reduce. If you want to work with the whole data. Can be used for feature creation. For Example: I had a use case where I had a graph of 60 Million customers and 130 Million accounts. Each account was connected to other account if they had the Same SSN or Same Name&#43;DOB&#43;Address. I had to find customer ID’s for each of the accounts. On a single node parsing such a graph took more than 2 days. On a Hadoop cluster of 80 nodes running a Connected Component Algorithm took less than 24 minutes. On Spark it is even faster.
3. Graph Algorithms. Recently I was working on an optimization problem which was focussed on finding shortest distance and routes between two points in a store layout. Routes which don’t pass through different aisles, so we cannot use euclidean distances. We solved this problem by considering turning points in the store layout and the djikstra’s Algorithm.
 4. Feature Selection.  Univariate Selection. Statistical tests can be used to select those features that have the strongest relationship with the output variable. VarianceThreshold. Feature selector that removes all low-variance features. Recursive Feature Elimination. The goal of recursive feature elimination (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features and weights are assigned to each one of them. Then, features whose absolute weights are the smallest are pruned from the current set features. That procedure is recursively repeated on the pruned set until the desired number of features to select is eventually reached. Feature Importance: Methods that use ensembles of decision trees (like Random Forest or Extra Trees) can also compute the relative importance of each attribute. These importance values can be used to inform a feature selection process.  5. Algorithms to work efficiently. Apart from these above algorithms sometimes you may need to write your own algorithms. Now I think of big algorithms as a combination of small but powerful algorithms. You just need to have idea of these algorithms to make a more better/efficient product. So some of these powerful algorithms which can help you are:
 Recursive Algorithms:Binary search algorithm. Divide and Conquer Algorithms: Merge-Sort. Dynamic Programming:Solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.  6. Classification/Regression Algorithms. The usual suspects. Minimum you must know:  Linear Regression - Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ElasticNet Logistic Regression From there you can build upon:  Decision Trees - ID3, CART, C4.5, C5.0 KNN SVM ANN - Back Propogation, CNN  And then on to Ensemble based algorithms:  Boosting: Gradient Boosted Trees Bagging: Random Forests Blending: Prediction outputs of different learning algorithms are fed into another learning algorithm.   7 . Clustering Methods.For unsupervised learning.  k-Means k-Medians Expectation Maximisation (EM) Hierarchical Clustering  8. Other algorithms you can learn about:  Apriori algorithm- Association Rule Mining Eclat algorithm - Association Rule Mining Item/User Based Similarity - Recommender Systems Reinforcement learning - Build your own robot. Graphical Models Bayesian Algorithms NLP - For language based models. Chatbots.  Hope this has been helpful&amp;hellip;..

        <![CDATA[  It has been quite a few days I have been working with Pandas and apparently I feel I have gotten quite good at it. (Quite a Braggard I know) So thought about adding a post about Pandas usage here. I intend to make this post quite practical and since I find the pandas syntax quite self explanatory, I won&amp;rsquo;t be explaining much of the codes. Just the use cases and the code to achieve them.
1. Import Pandas We Start by importing the libraries that we will need to use.
import pandas as pd 2. Read a Datasource: # Read from csv data files # With Header df = pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;/Users/ragarw5/Downloads/SalesJan2009.csv&amp;#34;) # Without Header. sep param to provide the delimiter df = pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;/Users/ragarw5/Downloads/SalesJan2009.csv&amp;#34;, header=None, sep= &amp;#34;,&amp;#34;) # Reading from SQL Datasource import MySQLdb from pandas import DataFrame from pandas.io.sql import read_sql db = MySQLdb.connect(host=&amp;#34;localhost&amp;#34;, # your host, usually localhost user=&amp;#34;root&amp;#34;, # your username passwd=&amp;#34;password&amp;#34;, # your password db=&amp;#34;dbname&amp;#34;) # name of the data base query = &amp;#34;SELECT * FROM tablename&amp;#34; data = read_sql(query, db) # Reading from ExcelFile data = pd.read_excel(filename) For now, we will be working with the file at http://samplecsvs.s3.amazonaws.com/SalesJan2009.csv. The Sales Jan 2009 file contains some “sanitized” sales transactions during the month of January. If you want to work along you can download this file from that location.
df = pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;/Users/ragarw5/Downloads/SalesJan2009.csv&amp;#34;) 3. See few rows of data: # top 5 rows df.head() # top 50 rows df.head(50) # last 5 rows df.tail() # last 50 rows df.tail(50) 4. Getting Column Names in a list: columnnames = df.columns 5. Specifying user defined Column Names: Sometimes you want to change the column names:
df.columns = [&amp;#39;Transdate&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Product&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;PaymentType&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Name&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;City&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;State&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Country&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;AccountCreated&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;LastLogin&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Latitude&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Longitude&amp;#39;] 6. Subsetting specific columns: Sometimes you only need to work with specific columns in a dataframe only. You can subset the columns in the dataframe using
newDf = df[[&amp;#39;Product&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;PaymentType&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Name&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;City&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;State&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Country&amp;#39;]] 7. Seeing column types: newDf.dtypes 8. Change type of a column First thing i try is this.
newDf[&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;] = newDf[&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;].astype(&amp;#39;int&amp;#39;) It gives error : ValueError: invalid literal for long() with base 10: &amp;lsquo;13,000&amp;rsquo;. That is you cannot cast a string with &amp;ldquo;,&amp;rdquo; to an int. To do that we first have to get rid of the comma. For that we use a particular lambda-apply functionality which lets us apply functions to each row in the data.
newDf[&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;] = newDf.apply(lambda x: int(x[&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;].replace(&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;&amp;#39;)),axis=1)  9. Simple Dataframe Statistics: # To get statistics of numerical columns newDf.describe() # To get maximum value of a column. When you take a single column you can think of it as a list and apply functions you would apply to a list max(newDf[&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;]) # no of rows in dataframe len(newDf) # Shape of Dataframe newDf.shape 10. Creating a new column: # Create a column Address containing City,State and Country. Simply concat the columns. newDf[&amp;#39;Address&amp;#39;] = newDf[&amp;#39;City&amp;#39;] &#43;&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;&#43; newDf[&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;] &#43;&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;&#43; newDf[&amp;#39;Country&amp;#39;] # I like to use a function defined approach with lambda-apply as it gives me more flexibility and more options. Like if i want to create a column which is 1 if the price is greater than 1200 and 0 otherwise. def gt(x): if x&amp;gt;1200: return 1 else: return 0 newDf[&amp;#39;Pricegt1200&amp;#39;] = newDf.apply(lambda x: gt(x[&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;]),axis=1) 11. Subset a DataFrame: # Single condition: dataframe with all entries priced greater than 1500 df_gt_1500 = newDf[newDf[&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;]&amp;gt;1500] # Multiple conditions: AND - dataframe with all entries priced greater than 1500 and from London And_df = newDf[(newDf[&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;]&amp;gt;1500) &amp;amp; (newDf[&amp;#39;City&amp;#39;]==&amp;#39;London&amp;#39;)] # Multiple conditions: OR - dataframe with all entries priced greater than 1500 or from London Or_df = newDf[(newDf[&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;]&amp;gt;1500) | (newDf[&amp;#39;City&amp;#39;]==&amp;#39;London&amp;#39;)] # Multiple conditions: NOT - dataframe with all entries priced greater than 1500 or from London have to be excluded Not_df = newDf[~((newDf[&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;]&amp;gt;1500) | (newDf[&amp;#39;City&amp;#39;]==&amp;#39;London&amp;#39;))] 12. Change the Column at particular places or impute: # In the state column the state is abbreviated as &amp;#39;TX&amp;#39;. We want the whole name &amp;#39;Texas&amp;#39; in there newDf.loc[newDf[&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;]==&amp;#39;TX&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;] = &amp;#39;Texas&amp;#39; # When City is Monaco State is not given. You want to impute &amp;#39;Monaco State&amp;#39; as state also. newDf.loc[newDf[&amp;#39;City&amp;#39;]==&amp;#39;Monaco&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;] = &amp;#39;Monaco State&amp;#39; 13. GroupBy: One of the most used functionality. One simple example
# Find out the sum of transactions by a state. reset_index() is a function that resets the index of a dataframe. I apply this function ALWAYS whenever I do a groupby and you might think of it as a default syntax for groupby operations import numpy as np newDf.groupby([&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;]).aggregate(np.sum).reset_index() # You might get a few extra columns that you dont need. Just subset the columns in the dataframe. You could just chain the commands to subset for the columns you need. newDf.groupby([&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;]).aggregate(np.sum).reset_index()[[&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;]] # Find minimum transaction in each state newDf.groupby([&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;]).aggregate(np.min).reset_index()[[&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;]] # You might want to groupby more than one column newDf.groupby([&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;City&amp;#39;]).aggregate(np.sum).reset_index()[[&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;City&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;]] 14. Concat: You have two datarames df1 and df2 you need to concat. Means append one below the other you can do it using:
pd.concat([df1,df2]) 15. Merge: #Suppose in the start, you had two dataframes. One which contains city and price information: City_Price = newwDf[[&amp;#39;City&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Price&amp;#39;]] #And another which contains &amp;#39;City&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;State&amp;#39; insformation City_State = newDf[[&amp;#39;City&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;]].drop_duplicates(keep=False).reset_index() #You need to merge these datatframes on basis of city. You need to do: City_Price_State_df = pd.merge(City_Price,City_State,on=[&amp;#39;City&amp;#39;],how=&amp;#39;left&amp;#39;) 16. Save a Dataframe to external File: # To Csv file newDf.to_csv(&amp;#34;NewDfData.csv&amp;#34;,index=False) # To Excel File from pandas import ExcelWriter writer = ExcelWriter(&amp;#39;NewDfData.xlsx&amp;#39;) newDf.to_excel(writer,&amp;#39;Sheet1&amp;#39;) writer.save() 17. Pushing Pandas Df to a sql database: from pandas.io import sql import MySQLdb db = MySQLdb.connect(host=&amp;#34;localhost&amp;#34;, # your host, usually localhost user=&amp;#34;root&amp;#34;, # your username passwd=&amp;#34;password&amp;#34;, # your password db=&amp;#34;dbname&amp;#34;) # name of the data base newDf.to_sql(con = db, name=&amp;#39;tablename&amp;#39;,if_exists=&amp;#39;append&amp;#39;,flavor=&amp;#39;mysql&amp;#39;, chunksize=10000,index=False) Hope you found this post useful and worth your time. I tried to make this as simple as possible but You may always ask me or see the documentation for doubts.
If you have any more ideas on how to use Pandas or other usecases, please suggest in the comments section.
Till then ciao!!

      <description>Yesterday I got introduced to awk programming on the shell and is it cool. It lets you do stuff on the command line which you never imagined. As a matter of fact, it&amp;amp;rsquo;s a whole data analytics software in itself when you think about it. You can do selections, groupby, mean, median, sum, duplication, append. You just ask. There is no limit actually.
And it is easy to learn.</description>

        <![CDATA[  Yesterday I got introduced to awk programming on the shell and is it cool. It lets you do stuff on the command line which you never imagined. As a matter of fact, it&amp;rsquo;s a whole data analytics software in itself when you think about it. You can do selections, groupby, mean, median, sum, duplication, append. You just ask. There is no limit actually.
And it is easy to learn.
In this post, I will try to give you a brief intro about how you could add awk to your daily work-flow.
Please see my previous post if you want some background or some basic to intermediate understanding of shell commands.
Basics/ Fundamentals So let me start with an example first. Say you wanted to sum a column in a comma delimited file. How would you do that in shell?
Here is the command. The great thing about awk is that it took me nearly 5 sec to write this command. I did not have to open any text editor to write a python script.
It lets you do adhoc work quickly.
awk &amp;#39;BEGIN{ sum=0; FS=&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;} { sum &#43;= $5 } END { print sum }&amp;#39; data.txt 44662539172  See the command one more time. There is a basic structure to the awk command
BEGIN {action} pattern {action} pattern {action} . . pattern { action} END {action}   An awk program consists of:
 An optional BEGIN segment : In the begin part we initialize our variables before we even start reading from the file or the standard input.
 pattern - action pairs: In the middle part we Process the input data. You put multiple pattern action pairs when you want to do multiple things with the same line.
 An optional END segment: In the end part we do something we want to do when we have reached the end of file.
  An awk command is called on a file using:
awk &amp;#39;BEGIN{SOMETHING HERE} {SOMETHING HERE: could put Multiple Blocks Like this} END {SOMETHING HERE}&amp;#39; file.txt You also need to know about these preinitialized variables that awk keeps track of.:
 FS : field separator. Default is whitespace (1 or more spaces or tabs). If you are using any other seperator in the file you should specify it in the Begin Part. RS : record separator. Default record separator is newline. Can be changed in BEGIN action. NR : NR is the variable whose value is the number of the current record. You normally use it in the action blocks in the middle. NF : The Number of Fields after the single line has been split up using FS. Dollar variables : awk splits up the line which is coming to it by using the given FS and keeps the split parts in the $ variables. For example column 1 is in $1, column 2 is in $2. $0 is the string representation of the whole line. Note that if you want to access last column you don&amp;rsquo;t have to count. You can just use $NF. For second last column you can use $(NF-1). Pretty handy. Right.  So If you are with me till here, the hard part is done. Now the fun part starts. Lets look at the first awk command again and try to understand it.
awk &amp;#39;BEGIN{ sum=0; FS=&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;} { sum &#43;= $5 } END { print sum }&amp;#39; data.txt So there is a begin block. Remember before we read any line. We initialize sum to 0 and FS to &amp;ldquo;,&amp;rdquo;.
Now as awk reads its input line by line it increments sum by the value in column 5(as specified by $5).
Note that there is no pattern specified here so awk will do the action for every line.
When awk has completed reading the file it prints out the sum.
What if you wanted mean?
We could create a cnt Variable:
awk &amp;#39;BEGIN{ sum=0;cnt=0; FS=&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;} { sum &#43;= $5; cnt&#43;=1 } END { print sum/cnt }&amp;#39; data.txt 1.86436e&#43;06  or better yet, use our friend NR which bash is already keeping track of:
awk &amp;#39;BEGIN{ sum=0; FS=&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;} { sum &#43;= $5 } END { print sum/NR }&amp;#39; data.txt 1.86436e&#43;06  Filter a file In the mean and sum awk commands we did not put any pattern in our middle commands. Let us use a simple pattern now. Suppose we have a file Salaries.csv which contains:
head salaries.txt yearID,teamID,lgID,playerID,salary 1985,BAL,AL,murraed02,1472819 1985,BAL,AL,lynnfr01,1090000 1985,BAL,AL,ripkeca01,800000 1985,BAL,AL,lacyle01,725000 1985,BAL,AL,flanami01,641667 1985,BAL,AL,boddimi01,625000 1985,BAL,AL,stewasa01,581250 1985,BAL,AL,martide01,560000 1985,BAL,AL,roeniga01,558333  I want to filter records for players who who earn more than 22 M in 2013 just because I want to. You just do:
awk &amp;#39;BEGIN{FS=&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;} $5&amp;gt;=22000000 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $1==2013{print $0}&amp;#39; Salaries.csv 2013,DET,AL,fieldpr01,23000000 2013,MIN,AL,mauerjo01,23000000 2013,NYA,AL,rodrial01,29000000 2013,NYA,AL,wellsve01,24642857 2013,NYA,AL,sabatcc01,24285714 2013,NYA,AL,teixema01,23125000 2013,PHI,NL,leecl02,25000000 2013,SFN,NL,linceti01,22250000  Cool right. Now let me explain it a little bit. The part in the command &amp;ldquo;$5&amp;gt;=22000000 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $1==2013&amp;rdquo; is called a pattern. It says that print this line($0) if and only if the Salary($5) is more than 22M and(&amp;amp;&amp;amp;) year($1) is equal to 2013. If the incoming record(line) does not satisfy this pattern it never reaches the inner block.
So Now you could do basic Select SQL at the command line only if you had:
The logic Operators:
 == equality operator; returns TRUE is both sides are equal
 != inverse equality operator
 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; logical AND
 || logical OR
 ! logical NOT
 &amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, &amp;lt;=, &amp;gt;= relational operators
  Normal Arithmetic Operators: &#43;, -, /, *, %, ^
Some String Functions: length, substr, split
GroupBy Now you will say: &amp;ldquo;Hey Dude SQL without groupby is incomplete&amp;rdquo;. You are right and for that we can use the associative array. Lets just see the command first and then I will explain. So lets create another useless use case(or may be something useful to someone :)) We want to find out the number of records for each year in the file. i.e we want to find the distribution of years in the file. Here is the command:
awk &amp;#39;BEGIN{FS=&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;} {my_array[$1]=my_array[$1]&#43;1} END{ for (k in my_array){if(k!=&amp;#34;yearID&amp;#34;)print k&amp;#34;|&amp;#34;my_array[k]}; }&amp;#39; Salaries.csv 1990|867 1991|685 1996|931 1997|925 ...  Now I would like to tell you a secret. You don&amp;rsquo;t really need to declare the variables you want to use in awk. So you did not really needed to define sum, cnt variables before. I only did that because it is good practice. If you don&amp;rsquo;t declare a user defined variable in awk, awk assumes it to be null or zero depending on the context. So in the command above we don&amp;rsquo;t declare our myarray in the begin block and that is fine.
Associative Array: The variable myarray is actually an associative array. i.e. It stores data in a key value format.(Python dictionaries anyone). The same array could keep integer keys and String keys. For example, I can do this in a single code.
myarray[1]=&#34;key&#34; myarray[&#39;mlwhiz&#39;] = 1   For Loop for associative arrays: I could use a for loop to read associative array
for (k in array) { DO SOMETHING } # Assigns to k each Key of array (unordered) # Element is array[k]   If Statement:Uses a syntax like C for the if statement. the else block is optional:
if (n  0){ DO SOMETHING } else{ DO SOMETHING }   So lets dissect the above command now.
I set the File separator to &amp;ldquo;,&amp;rdquo; in the beginning. I use the first column as the key of myarray. If the key exists I increment the value by 1.
At the end, I loop through all the keys and print out key value pairs separated by &amp;ldquo;|&amp;rdquo;
I know that the header line in my file contains &amp;ldquo;yearID&amp;rdquo; in column 1 and I don&amp;rsquo;t want &amp;lsquo;yearID|1&amp;rsquo; in the output. So I only print when Key is not equal to &amp;lsquo;yearID&amp;rsquo;.
GroupBy with case statement: cat Salaries.csv | awk &amp;#39;BEGIN{FS=&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;} $5&amp;lt;100000{array5[&amp;#34;[0-100000)&amp;#34;]&#43;=1} $5&amp;gt;=100000&amp;amp;&amp;amp;$5&amp;lt;250000{array5[&amp;#34;[100000,250000)&amp;#34;]=array5[&amp;#34;[100000,250000)&amp;#34;]&#43;1} $5&amp;gt;=250000&amp;amp;&amp;amp;$5&amp;lt;500000{array5[&amp;#34;[250000-500000)&amp;#34;]=array5[&amp;#34;[250000-500000)&amp;#34;]&#43;1} $5&amp;gt;=500000&amp;amp;&amp;amp;$5&amp;lt;1000000{array5[&amp;#34;[500000-1000000)&amp;#34;]=array5[&amp;#34;[500000-1000000)&amp;#34;]&#43;1} $5&amp;gt;=1000000{array5[&amp;#34;[1000000)&amp;#34;]=array5[&amp;#34;[1000000)&amp;#34;]&#43;1} END{ print &amp;#34;VAR Distrib:&amp;#34;; for (v in array5){print v&amp;#34;|&amp;#34;array5[v]} }&amp;#39; VAR Distrib: [250000-500000)|8326 [0-100000)|2 [1000000)|23661 [100000,250000)|9480  Here we used multiple pattern-action blocks to create a case statement.
For The Brave: This is a awk code that I wrote to calculate the Mean,Median,min,max and sum of a column simultaneously. Try to go through the code and understand it.I have added comments too. Think of this as an exercise. Try to run this code and play with it. You may learn some new tricks in the process. If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand it do not worry. Just get started writing your own awk codes, you will be able to understand it in very little time.
# Create a New file named A.txt to keep only the salary column. cat Salaries.csv | cut -d &amp;#34;,&amp;#34; -f 5 &amp;gt; A.txt FILENAME=&amp;#34;A.txt&amp;#34; # The first awk counts the number of lines which are numeric. We use a regex here to check if the column is numeric or not. # &amp;#39;;&amp;#39; stands for Synchronous execution i.e sort only runs after the awk is over. # The output of both commands are given to awk command which does the whole work. # So Now the first line going to the second awk is the number of lines in the file which are numeric. # and from the second to the end line the file is sorted. (awk &amp;#39;BEGIN {c=0} $1 ~ /^[-0-9]*(\.[0-9]*)?$/ {c=c&#43;1;} END {print c;}&amp;#39; &amp;#34;$FILENAME&amp;#34;; \  sort -n &amp;#34;$FILENAME&amp;#34;) | awk &amp;#39; BEGIN { c = 0; sum = 0; med1_loc = 0; med2_loc = 0; med1_val = 0; med2_val = 0; min = 0; max = 0; } NR==1 { LINES = $1 # We check whether numlines is even or odd so that we keep only # the locations in the array where the median might be. if (LINES%2==0) {med1_loc = LINES/2-1; med2_loc = med1_loc&#43;1;} if (LINES%2!=0) {med1_loc = med2_loc = (LINES-1)/2;} } $1 ~ /^[-0-9]*(\.[0-9]*)?$/ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; NR!=1 { # setting min value if (c==0) {min = $1;} # middle two values in array if (c==med1_loc) {med1_val = $1;} if (c==med2_loc) {med2_val = $1;} c&#43;&#43; sum &#43;= $1 max = $1 } END { ave = sum / c median = (med1_val &#43; med2_val ) / 2 print &amp;#34;sum:&amp;#34; sum print &amp;#34;count:&amp;#34; c print &amp;#34;mean:&amp;#34; ave print &amp;#34;median:&amp;#34; median print &amp;#34;min:&amp;#34; min print &amp;#34;max:&amp;#34; max } &amp;#39; &amp;lt;pre style=&amp;#34;font-size:50%; padding:7px; margin:0em; background-color:#FFF112&amp;#34;&amp;gt;sum:44662539172 count:23956 mean:1.86436e&#43;06 median:507950 min:0 max:33000000 &amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; Endnote: awk is an awesome tool and there are a lot of use-cases where it can make your life simple. There is a sort of a learning curve, but I think that it would be worth it in the long term. I have tried to give you a taste of awk and I have covered a lot of ground here in this post. To tell you a bit more there, awk is a full programming language. There are for loops, while loops, conditionals, booleans, functions and everything else that you would expect from a programming language. So you could look more still.
To learn more about awk you can use this book. This book is a free resource and you could learn more about awk and use cases.
Or if you like to have your book binded and in paper like me you can buy this book, which is a gem:
Do leave comments in case you find more use-cases for awk or if you want me to write on new use-cases. Or just comment weather you liked it or not and how I could improve as I am also new and trying to learn more of this.
Till then Ciao !!!

        <![CDATA[  Shell Commands are powerful. And life would be like hell without shell is how I like to say it(And that is probably the reason that I dislike windows).
Consider a case when you have a 6 GB pipe-delimited file sitting on your laptop and you want to find out the count of distinct values in one particular column. You can probably do this in more than one way. You could put that file in a database and run SQL Commands, or you could write a python/perl script.
Probably whatever you do it won&amp;rsquo;t be simpler/less time consuming than this
cat data.txt | cut -d &amp;#34;|&amp;#34; -f 1 | sort | uniq | wc -l 30  And this will run way faster than whatever you do with perl/python script.
Now this command says
 Use the cat command to print/stream the contents of the file to stdout. Pipe the streaming contents from our cat command to the next command cut. The cut commands specifies the delimiter by the argument -d and the column by the argument -f and streams the output to stdout. Pipe the streaming content to the sort command which sorts the input and streams only the distinct values to the stdout. It takes the argument -u that specifies that we only need unique values. Pipe the output to the wc -l command which counts the number of lines in the input.  There is a lot going on here and I will try my best to ensure that you will be able to understand most of it by the end of this Blog post.Although I will also try to explain more advanced concepts than the above command in this post.
Now, I use shell commands extensively at my job. I will try to explain the usage of each of the commands based on use cases that I counter nearly daily at may day job as a data scientist.
Some Basic Commands in Shell: There are a lot of times when you just need to know a little bit about the data. You just want to see may be a couple of lines to inspect a file. One way of doing this is opening the txt/csv file in the notepad. And that is probably the best way for small files. But you could also do it in the shell using:
1. cat cat data.txt yearID|teamID|lgID|playerID|salary 1985|BAL|AL|murraed02|1472819 1985|BAL|AL|lynnfr01|1090000 1985|BAL|AL|ripkeca01|800000 1985|BAL|AL|lacyle01|725000 1985|BAL|AL|flanami01|641667 1985|BAL|AL|boddimi01|625000 1985|BAL|AL|stewasa01|581250 1985|BAL|AL|martide01|560000 1985|BAL|AL|roeniga01|558333  Now the cat command prints the whole file in the terminal window for you.I have not shown the whole file here.
But sometimes the files will be so big that you wont be able to open them up in notepad&#43;&#43; or any other software utility and there the cat command will shine.
2. Head and Tail Now you might ask me why would you print the whole file in the terminal itself? Generally I won&amp;rsquo;t. But I just wanted to tell you about the cat command. For the use case when you want only the top/bottom n lines of your data you will generally use the head/tail commands. You can use them as below.
head data.txt yearID|teamID|lgID|playerID|salary 1985|BAL|AL|murraed02|1472819 1985|BAL|AL|lynnfr01|1090000 1985|BAL|AL|ripkeca01|800000 1985|BAL|AL|lacyle01|725000 1985|BAL|AL|flanami01|641667 1985|BAL|AL|boddimi01|625000 1985|BAL|AL|stewasa01|581250 1985|BAL|AL|martide01|560000 1985|BAL|AL|roeniga01|558333  head -n 3 data.txt yearID|teamID|lgID|playerID|salary 1985|BAL|AL|murraed02|1472819 1985|BAL|AL|lynnfr01|1090000  tail data.txt 2013|WAS|NL|bernaro01|1212500 2013|WAS|NL|tracych01|1000000 2013|WAS|NL|stammcr01|875000 2013|WAS|NL|dukeza01|700000 2013|WAS|NL|espinda01|526250 2013|WAS|NL|matthry01|504500 2013|WAS|NL|lombast02|501250 2013|WAS|NL|ramoswi01|501250 2013|WAS|NL|rodrihe03|501000 2013|WAS|NL|moorety01|493000  tail -n 2 data.txt 2013|WAS|NL|rodrihe03|501000 2013|WAS|NL|moorety01|493000  Notice the structure of the shell command here.
CommandName [-arg1name] [arg1value] [-arg2name] [arg2value] filename   3. Piping Now we could have also written the same command as:
cat data.txt | head yearID|teamID|lgID|playerID|salary 1985|BAL|AL|murraed02|1472819 1985|BAL|AL|lynnfr01|1090000 1985|BAL|AL|ripkeca01|800000 1985|BAL|AL|lacyle01|725000 1985|BAL|AL|flanami01|641667 1985|BAL|AL|boddimi01|625000 1985|BAL|AL|stewasa01|581250 1985|BAL|AL|martide01|560000 1985|BAL|AL|roeniga01|558333  This brings me to one of the most important concepts of Shell usage - piping. You won&amp;rsquo;t be able to utilize the full power the shell provides without using this concept. And the concept is actually simple.
Just read the &amp;ldquo;|&amp;rdquo; in the command as &amp;ldquo;pass the data on to&amp;rdquo;
So I would read the above command as:
cat(print) the whole data to stream, pass the data on to head so that it can just give me the first few lines only.
So did you understood what piping did? It is providing us a way to use our basic commands in a consecutive manner. There are a lot of commands that are fairly basic and it lets us use these basic commands in sequence to do some fairly non trivial things.
Now let me tell you about a couple of more commands before I show you how we can chain them to do fairly advanced tasks.
4. wc wc is a fairly useful shell utility/command that lets us count the number of lines(-l), words(-w) or characters(-c) in a given file
wc -l data.txt 23957 data.txt  5. grep You may want to print all the lines in your file which have a particular word. Or as a Data case you might like to see the salaries for the team BAL in 2000. In this case we have printed all the lines in the file which contain &amp;ldquo;2000|BAL&amp;rdquo;. grep is your friend.
grep &amp;#34;2000|BAL&amp;#34; data.txt | head 2000|BAL|AL|belleal01|12868670 2000|BAL|AL|anderbr01|7127199 2000|BAL|AL|mussimi01|6786032 2000|BAL|AL|ericksc01|6620921 2000|BAL|AL|ripkeca01|6300000 2000|BAL|AL|clarkwi02|6000000 2000|BAL|AL|johnsch04|4600000 2000|BAL|AL|timlimi01|4250000 2000|BAL|AL|deshide01|4209324 2000|BAL|AL|surhobj01|4146789  you could also use regular expressions with grep.
6. sort You may want to sort your dataset on a particular column.Sort is your friend. Say you want to find out the top 10 maximum salaries given to any player in your dataset.
sort -t &amp;#34;|&amp;#34; -k 5 -r -n data.txt | head -10 2010|NYA|AL|rodrial01|33000000 2009|NYA|AL|rodrial01|33000000 2011|NYA|AL|rodrial01|32000000 2012|NYA|AL|rodrial01|30000000 2013|NYA|AL|rodrial01|29000000 2008|NYA|AL|rodrial01|28000000 2011|LAA|AL|wellsve01|26187500 2005|NYA|AL|rodrial01|26000000 2013|PHI|NL|leecl02|25000000 2013|NYA|AL|wellsve01|24642857  So there are certainly a lot of options in this command. Lets go through them one by one.
 -t: Which delimiter to use? -k: Which column to sort on? -n: If you want Numerical Sorting. Dont use this option if you want Lexographical sorting. -r: I want to sort Descending. Sorts Ascending by Default.  7. cut This command lets you select certain columns from your data. Sometimes you may want to look at just some of the columns in your data. As in you may want to look only at the year, team and salary and not the other columns. cut is the command to use.
cut -d &amp;#34;|&amp;#34; -f 1,2,5 data.txt | head yearID|teamID|salary 1985|BAL|1472819 1985|BAL|1090000 1985|BAL|800000 1985|BAL|725000 1985|BAL|641667 1985|BAL|625000 1985|BAL|581250 1985|BAL|560000 1985|BAL|558333  The options are:
 -d: Which delimiter to use? -f: Which column/columns to cut?  8. uniq uniq is a little bit tricky as in you will want to use this command in sequence with sort. This command removes sequential duplicates. So in conjunction with sort it can be used to get the distinct values in the data. For example if I wanted to find out 10 distinct teamIDs in data, I would use:
cat data.txt | cut -d &amp;#34;|&amp;#34; -f 2 | sort | uniq | head ANA ARI ATL BAL BOS CAL CHA CHN CIN CLE  This command could be used with argument -c to count the occurrence of these distinct values. Something akin to count distinct.
cat data.txt | cut -d &amp;#34;|&amp;#34; -f 2 | sort | uniq -c | head 247 ANA 458 ARI 838 ATL 855 BAL 852 BOS 368 CAL 812 CHA 821 CHN 46 CIN 867 CLE  Some Other Utility Commands for Other Operations Some Other command line tools that you could use without going in the specifics as the specifics are pretty hard.
1. Change delimiter in a file Find and Replace Magic.: You may want to replace certain characters in file with something else using the tr command.
cat data.txt | tr &amp;#39;|&amp;#39; &amp;#39;,&amp;#39; | head -4 yearID,teamID,lgID,playerID,salary 1985,BAL,AL,murraed02,1472819 1985,BAL,AL,lynnfr01,1090000 1985,BAL,AL,ripkeca01,800000  or the sed command
cat data.txt | sed -e &amp;#39;s/|/,/g&amp;#39; | head -4 yearID,teamID,lgID,playerID,salary 1985,BAL,AL,murraed02,1472819 1985,BAL,AL,lynnfr01,1090000 1985,BAL,AL,ripkeca01,800000  2. Sum of a column in a file Using the awk command you could find the sum of column in file. Divide it by the number of lines and you can get the mean.
cat data.txt | awk -F &amp;#34;|&amp;#34; &amp;#39;{ sum &#43;= $5 } END { printf sum }&amp;#39; 44662539172  awk is a powerful command which is sort of a whole language in itself. Do see the wiki page for awk for a lot of great usecases of awk. I also wrote a post on awk as a second part in this series. Check it HERE
3. Find the files in a directory that satisfy a certain condition You can do this by using the find command. Lets say you want to find all the .txt files in the current working dir that start with lowercase h.
find . -name &amp;#34;h*.txt&amp;#34; ./hamlet.txt  To find all .txt files starting with h regarless of case we could use regex.
find . -name &amp;#34;[Hh]*.txt&amp;#34; ./hamlet.txt ./Hamlet1.txt  4. Passing file list as Argument. xargs was suggested by Gaurav in the comments, so I read about it and it is actually a very nice command which you could use in a variety of use cases.
So if you just use a pipe, any command/utility receives data on STDIN (the standard input stream) as a raw pile of data that it can sort through one line at a time. However some programs don&amp;rsquo;t accept their commands on standard in. For example the rm command(which is used to remove files), touch command(used to create file with a given name) or a certain python script you wrote(which takes command line arguments). They expect it to be spelled out in the arguments to the command.
For example: rm takes a file name as a parameter on the command line like so: rm file1.txt. If I wanted to delete all &amp;lsquo;.txt&amp;rsquo; files starting with &amp;ldquo;h/H&amp;rdquo; from my working directory, the below command won&amp;rsquo;t work because rm expects a file as an input.
find . -name &amp;#34;[hH]*.txt&amp;#34; | rm usage: rm [-f | -i] [-dPRrvW] file ... unlink file  To get around it we can use the xargs command which reads the STDIN stream data and converts each line into space separated arguments to the command.
find . -name &amp;#34;[hH]*.txt&amp;#34; | xargs ./hamlet.txt ./Hamlet1.txt  Now you could use rm to remove all .txt files that start with h/H. A word of advice: Always see the output of xargs first before using rm.
find . -name &amp;#34;[hH]*.txt&amp;#34; | xargs rm Another usage of xargs could be in conjunction with grep to find all files that contain a given string.
find . -name &amp;#34;*.txt&amp;#34; | xargs grep &amp;#39;honest soldier&amp;#39; ./Data1.txt:O, farewell, honest soldier; ./Data2.txt:O, farewell, honest soldier; ./Data3.txt:O, farewell, honest soldier;  Hopefully You could come up with varied uses building up on these examples. One other use case could be to use this for passing arguments to a python script.
Other Cool Tricks Sometimes you want your data that you got by some command line utility(Shell commands/ Python scripts) not to be shown on stdout but stored in a textfile. You can use the &amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; operator for that. For Example: You could have stored the file after replacing the delimiters in the previous example into anther file called newdata.txt as follows:
cat data.txt | tr &amp;#39;|&amp;#39; &amp;#39;,&amp;#39; &amp;gt; newdata.txt I really got confused between &amp;rdquo;|&amp;rdquo; (piping) and &amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; (to_file) operations a lot in the beginning. One way to remember is that you should only use &amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; when you want to write something to a file. &amp;rdquo;|&amp;rdquo; cannot be used to write to a file. Another operation you should know about is the &amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; operation. It is analogous to &amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; but it appends to an existing file rather that replacing the file and writing over.
If you would like to know more about commandline, which I guess you would, here are some books that I would recommend for a beginner:
The first book is more of a fun read at leisure type of book. THe second book is a little more serious. Whatever suits you.
So, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Although I am not an expert in shell usage, these commands reduced my workload to a large extent. If there are some shell commands you use on a regular basis or some shell command that are cool, do tell in the comments. I would love to include it in the blogpost.

        <![CDATA[  When it comes to data preparation and getting acquainted with data, the one step we normally skip is the data visualization. While a part of it could be attributed to the lack of good visualization tools for the platforms we use, most of us also get lazy at times.
Now as we know of it Python never had any good Visualization library. For most of our plotting needs, I would read up blogs, hack up with StackOverflow solutions and haggle with Matplotlib documentation each and every time I needed to make a simple graph. This led me to think that a Blog post to create common Graph types in Python is in order. But being the procrastinator that I am it always got pushed to the back of my head.
One thing that helped me in pursuit of my data visualization needs in Python was this awesome course about Data Visualization and applied plotting from University of Michigan which is a part of a pretty good Data Science Specialization with Python in itself. Highly Recommended.
But, yesterday I got introduced to Seaborn and I must say I am quite impressed with it. It makes beautiful graphs that are in my opinion better than R&amp;rsquo;s ggplot2. Gives you enough options to customize and the best part is that it is so easy to learn.
So I am finally writing this blog post with a basic purpose of creating a code base that provides me with ready to use codes which could be put into analysis in a fairly straight-forward manner.
Right. So here Goes.
We Start by importing the libraries that we will need to use.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #sets up plotting under plt import seaborn as sns #sets up styles and gives us more plotting options import pandas as pd #lets us handle data as dataframes To create a use case for our graphs, we will be working with the Tips data that contains the following information.
tips = sns.load_dataset(&amp;#34;tips&amp;#34;) tips.head()   Scatterplot With Regression Line Now let us work on visualizing this data. We will use the regplot option in seaborn.
# We dont Probably need the Gridlines. Do we? If yes comment this line sns.set(style=&amp;#34;ticks&amp;#34;) # Here we create a matplotlib axes object. The extra parameters we use # &amp;#34;ci&amp;#34; to remove confidence interval # &amp;#34;marker&amp;#34; to have a x as marker. # &amp;#34;scatter_kws&amp;#34; to provide style info for the points.[s for size] # &amp;#34;line_kws&amp;#34; to provide style info for the line.[lw for line width] g = sns.regplot(x=&amp;#34;tip&amp;#34;, y=&amp;#34;total_bill&amp;#34;, data=tips, ci = False, scatter_kws={&amp;#34;color&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;darkred&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;alpha&amp;#34;:0.3,&amp;#34;s&amp;#34;:90}, line_kws={&amp;#34;color&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;g&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;alpha&amp;#34;:0.5,&amp;#34;lw&amp;#34;:4},marker=&amp;#34;x&amp;#34;) # remove the top and right line in graph sns.despine() # Set the size of the graph from here g.figure.set_size_inches(12,8) # Set the Title of the graph from here g.axes.set_title(&amp;#39;Total Bill vs. Tip&amp;#39;, fontsize=34,color=&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the xlabel of the graph from here g.set_xlabel(&amp;#34;Tip&amp;#34;,size = 67,color=&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the ylabel of the graph from here g.set_ylabel(&amp;#34;Total Bill&amp;#34;,size = 67,color=&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the ticklabel size and color of the graph from here g.tick_params(labelsize=14,labelcolor=&amp;#34;black&amp;#34;)   Now that required a bit of a code but i feel that it looks much better than what either Matplotlib or ggPlot2 could have rendered. We got a lot of customization without too much code.
But that is not really what actually made me like Seaborn. The plot type that actually got my attention was lmplot, which lets us use regplot in a faceted mode.
# So this function creates a faceted plot. The plot is parameterized by the following: # col : divides the data points into days and creates that many plots # palette: deep, muted, pastel, bright, dark, and colorblind. change the colors in graph. Experiment with these # col_wrap: we want 2 graphs in a row? Yes.We do # scatter_kws: attributes for points # hue: Colors on a particular column. # size: controls the size of graph g = sns.lmplot(x=&amp;#34;tip&amp;#34;, y=&amp;#34;total_bill&amp;#34;,ci=None,data=tips, col=&amp;#34;day&amp;#34;, palette=&amp;#34;muted&amp;#34;,col_wrap=2,scatter_kws={&amp;#34;s&amp;#34;: 100,&amp;#34;alpha&amp;#34;:.5}, line_kws={&amp;#34;lw&amp;#34;:4,&amp;#34;alpha&amp;#34;:0.5},hue=&amp;#34;day&amp;#34;,x_jitter=1.0,y_jitter=1.0,size=6) # remove the top and right line in graph sns.despine() # Additional line to adjust some appearance issue plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9) # Set the Title of the graph from here g.fig.suptitle(&amp;#39;Total Bill vs. Tip&amp;#39;, fontsize=34,color=&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the xlabel of the graph from here g.set_xlabels(&amp;#34;Tip&amp;#34;,size = 50,color=&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the ylabel of the graph from here g.set_ylabels(&amp;#34;Total Bill&amp;#34;,size = 50,color=&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the ticklabel size and color of the graph from here titles = [&amp;#39;Thursday&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Friday&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Saturday&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Sunday&amp;#39;] for ax,title in zip(g.axes.flat,titles): ax.tick_params(labelsize=14,labelcolor=&amp;#34;black&amp;#34;)   A side Note on Palettes:
You can build your own color palettes using color_palette() function. color_palette() will accept the name of any seaborn palette or matplotlib colormap(except jet, which you should never use). It can also take a list of colors specified in any valid matplotlib format (RGB tuples, hex color codes, or HTML color names). The return value is always a list of RGB tuples. This allows you to use your own color palettes in graph.   Barplots sns.set(style=&amp;#34;ticks&amp;#34;) flatui = [&amp;#34;#9b59b6&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#3498db&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#95a5a6&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#e74c3c&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#34495e&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;#2ecc71&amp;#34;] # This Function takes as input a custom palette g = sns.barplot(x=&amp;#34;sex&amp;#34;, y=&amp;#34;tip&amp;#34;, hue=&amp;#34;day&amp;#34;, palette=sns.color_palette(flatui),data=tips,ci=None) # remove the top and right line in graph sns.despine() # Set the size of the graph from here g.figure.set_size_inches(12,7) # Set the Title of the graph from here g.axes.set_title(&amp;#39;Do We tend to \nTip high on Weekends?&amp;#39;, fontsize=34,color=&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;,alpha=0.3) # Set the xlabel of the graph from here g.set_xlabel(&amp;#34;Gender&amp;#34;,size = 67,color=&amp;#34;g&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the ylabel of the graph from here g.set_ylabel(&amp;#34;Mean Tips&amp;#34;,size = 67,color=&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the ticklabel size and color of the graph from here g.tick_params(labelsize=14,labelcolor=&amp;#34;black&amp;#34;)   Histograms and Distribution Diagrams They form another part of my workflow. Lets plot the normal Histogram using seaborn. For this we will use the distplot function. This function combines the matplotlib hist function (with automatic calculation of a good default bin size) with the seaborn kdeplot() function. It can also fit scipy.stats distributions and plot the estimated PDF over the data.
# Create a list of 1000 Normal RVs x = np.random.normal(size=1000) sns.set_context(&amp;#34;poster&amp;#34;) sns.set_style(&amp;#34;ticks&amp;#34;) # This Function creates a normed Histogram by default. # If we use the parameter kde=False and norm_hist=False then # we will be using a count histogram g=sns.distplot(x, kde_kws={&amp;#34;color&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;g&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;lw&amp;#34;:4,&amp;#34;label&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;KDE Estim&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;alpha&amp;#34;:0.5}, hist_kws={&amp;#34;color&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;alpha&amp;#34;:0.3,&amp;#34;label&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;Freq&amp;#34;}) # remove the top and right line in graph sns.despine() # Set the size of the graph from here g.figure.set_size_inches(12,7) # Set the Title of the graph from here g.axes.set_title(&amp;#39;Normal Simulation&amp;#39;, fontsize=34,color=&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;,alpha=0.3) # Set the xlabel of the graph from here g.set_xlabel(&amp;#34;X&amp;#34;,size = 67,color=&amp;#34;g&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the ylabel of the graph from here g.set_ylabel(&amp;#34;Density&amp;#34;,size = 67,color=&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the ticklabel size and color of the graph from here g.tick_params(labelsize=14,labelcolor=&amp;#34;black&amp;#34;)   import scipy.stats as stats a = 1.5 b = 1.5 x = np.arange(0.01, 1, 0.01) y = stats.beta.rvs(a,b,size=10000) y_act = stats.beta.pdf(x,a,b) g=sns.distplot(y,kde=False,norm_hist=True, kde_kws={&amp;#34;color&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;g&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;lw&amp;#34;:4,&amp;#34;label&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;KDE Estim&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;alpha&amp;#34;:0.5}, hist_kws={&amp;#34;color&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;alpha&amp;#34;:0.3,&amp;#34;label&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;Freq&amp;#34;}) # Note that we plotted on the graph using plt matlabplot function plt.plot(x,y_act) # remove the top and right line in graph sns.despine() # Set the size of the graph from here g.figure.set_size_inches(12,7) # Set the Title of the graph from here g.axes.set_title((&amp;#34;Beta Simulation vs. Calculated Beta Density\nFor a=%s,b=%s&amp;#34;) %(a,b),fontsize=34,color=&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;,alpha=0.3) # Set the xlabel of the graph from here g.set_xlabel(&amp;#34;X&amp;#34;,size = 67,color=&amp;#34;g&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the ylabel of the graph from here g.set_ylabel(&amp;#34;Density&amp;#34;,size = 67,color=&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;,alpha=0.5) # Set the ticklabel size and color of the graph from here g.tick_params(labelsize=14,labelcolor=&amp;#34;black&amp;#34;)   PairPlots You need to see how variables vary with one another. What is the distribution of variables in the dataset. This is the graph to use with the pairplot function. Very helpful And Seaborn males it a joy to use. We will use Iris Dataset here for this example.
iris = sns.load_dataset(&amp;#34;iris&amp;#34;) iris.head()   # Create a Pairplot g = sns.pairplot(iris,hue=&amp;#34;species&amp;#34;,palette=&amp;#34;muted&amp;#34;,size=5, vars=[&amp;#34;sepal_width&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;sepal_length&amp;#34;],kind=&amp;#39;reg&amp;#39;,markers=[&amp;#39;o&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;x&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;&#43;&amp;#39;]) # To change the size of the scatterpoints in graph g = g.map_offdiag(plt.scatter, s=35,alpha=0.5) # remove the top and right line in graph sns.despine() # Additional line to adjust some appearance issue plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9) # Set the Title of the graph from here g.fig.suptitle(&amp;#39;Relation between Sepal Width and Sepal Length&amp;#39;, fontsize=34,color=&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;,alpha=0.3)   Hope you found this post useful and worth your time. You can find the iPython notebook at github
I tried to make this as simple as possible but You may always ask me or see the documentation for doubts.
If you have any more ideas on how to use Seaborn or which graphs should i add here, please suggest in the comments section.
I will definitely try to add to this post as I start using more visualizations and encounter other libraries as good as seaborn.
Also since this is my first visualization post on this blog, I would like to call out a good course about Data Visualization and applied plotting from University of Michigan which is a part of a pretty good Data Science Specialization with Python in itself. Do check it out.

      <description>Last time I wrote an article on MCMC and how they could be useful. We learned how MCMC chains could be used to simulate from a random variable whose distribution is partially known i.e. we don&amp;amp;rsquo;t know the normalizing constant.
So MCMC Methods may sound interesting to some (for these what follows is a treat) and for those who don&amp;amp;rsquo;t really appreciate MCMC till now, I hope I will be able to pique your interest by the end of this blog post.</description>

        <![CDATA[    Last time I wrote an article on MCMC and how they could be useful. We learned how MCMC chains could be used to simulate from a random variable whose distribution is partially known i.e. we don&amp;rsquo;t know the normalizing constant.
So MCMC Methods may sound interesting to some (for these what follows is a treat) and for those who don&amp;rsquo;t really appreciate MCMC till now, I hope I will be able to pique your interest by the end of this blog post.
So here goes. This time we will cover some applications of MCMC in various areas of Computer Science using Python. If you feel the problems difficult to follow with, I would advice you to go back and read the previous post, which tries to explain MCMC Methods. We Will try to solve the following two problems:
 Breaking the Code - This problem has got somewhat of a great pedigree as this method was suggested by Persi Diaconis- The Mathemagician. So Someone comes to you with the below text. This text looks like gibberish but this is a code, Could you decrypyt it?
XZ STAVRK HXVR MYAZ OAKZM JKSSO SO MYR OKRR XDP JKSJRK XBMASD SO YAZ TWDHZ MYR JXMBYNSKF BSVRKTRM NYABY NXZ BXKRTRZZTQ OTWDH SVRK MYR AKSD ERPZMRXP KWZMTRP MYR JXTR OXBR SO X QSWDH NSIXD NXZ KXAZRP ORRETQ OKSI MYR JATTSN XDP X OXADM VSABR AIJRKORBMTQ XKMABWTXMRP MYR NSKPZ TRM IR ZRR MYR BYATP XDP PAR MYR ZWKHRSD YXP ERRD ZAMMADH NAMY YAZ OXBR MWKDRP MSNXKPZ MYR OAKR HAVADH MYR JXTIZ SO YAZ YXDPZ X NXKI XDP X KWE XTMRKDXMRTQ XZ MYR QSWDH NSIXD ZJSFR YR KSZR XDP XPVXDBADH MS MYR ERP Z YRXP ZXAP NAMY ISKR FADPDRZZ MYXD IAHYM YXVR ERRD RGJRBMRP SO YAI
 The Knapsack Problem - This problem comes from Introduction to Probability by Joseph Blitzstein. You should check out his courses STAT110 and CS109 as they are awesome. Also as it turns out Diaconis was the advisor of Joseph. So you have Bilbo a Thief who goes to Smaug&amp;rsquo;s Lair. He finds M treasures. Each treasure has some Weight and some Gold value. But Bilbo cannot really take all of that. He could only carry a certain Maximum Weight. But being a smart hobbit, he wants to Maximize the value of the treasures he takes. Given the values for weights and value of the treasures and the maximum weight that Bilbo could carry, could you find a good solution? This is known as the Knapsack Problem in Computer Science.
  Breaking the Code   So we look at the data and form a hypothesis that the data has been scrambled using a Substitution Cipher. We don&amp;rsquo;t know the encryption key, and we would like to know the Decryption Key so that we can decrypt the data and read the code.
To create this example, this data has actually been taken from Oliver Twist. We scrambled the data using a random encryption key, which we forgot after encrypting and we would like to decrypt this encrypted text using MCMC Chains. The real decryption key actually is &amp;ldquo;ICZNBKXGMPRQTWFDYEOLJVUAHS&amp;rdquo;
So lets think about this problem for a little bit. The decryption key could be any 26 letter string with all alphabets appearing exactly once. How many string permutations are there like that? That number would come out to be $26! \approx 10^{26}$ permutations. That is a pretty large number. If we go for using a brute force approach we are screwed. So what could we do? MCMC Chains come to rescue.
We will devise a Chain whose states theoritically could be any of these permutations. Then we will:
 Start by picking up a random current state. Create a proposal for a new state by swapping two random letters in the current state. Use a Scoring Function which calculates the score of the current state $Score_C$ and the proposed State $Score_P$. If the score of the proposed state is more than current state, Move to Proposed State. Else flip a coin which has a probability of Heads $Score_P/Score_C$. If it comes heads move to proposed State. Repeat from 2nd State.  If we get lucky we may reach a steady state where the chain has the stationary distribution of the needed states and the state that the chain is at could be used as a solution.
So the Question is what is the scoring function that we will want to use. We want to use a scoring function for each state(Decryption key) which assigns a positive score to each decryption key. This score intuitively should be more if the encrypted text looks more like actual english if decrypted using this decryption key.
So how can we quantify such a function. We will check a long text and calculate some statistics. See how many times one alphabet comes after another in a legitimate long text like War and Peace. For example we want to find out how many times does &amp;lsquo;BA&amp;rsquo; appears in the text or how many times &amp;lsquo;TH&amp;rsquo; occurs in the text.
For each pair of characters $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ (e.g. $\beta_1$ = T and $\beta_2$ =H), we let $R(\beta_1,\beta_2)$ record the number of times that specific pair(e.g. &amp;ldquo;TH&amp;rdquo;) appears consecutively in the reference text.
Similarly, for a putative decryption key x, we let $F_x(\beta_1,\beta_2)$ record the number of times that pair appears when the cipher text is decrypted using the decryption key x.
We then Score a particular decryption key x using:
$$Score(x) = \prod R(\beta_1,\beta_2)^{F_x(\beta_1,\beta_2)}$$ This function can be thought of as multiplying, for each consecutive pair of letters in the decrypted text, the number of times that pair occurred in the reference text. Intuitively, the score function is higher when the pair frequencies in the decrypted text most closely match those of the reference text, and the decryption key is thus most likely to be correct.
To make life easier with calculations we will calculate $log(Score(x))$
So lets start working through the problem step by step.

That&amp;rsquo;s awesome!!! Now as you see the MCMC Key found is not exactly the encryption key. So the solution is not a deterministic one, but we can see that it does not actually decrease any of the value that the MCMC Methods provide. Now Lets Help Bilbo :)
The Knapsack Problem Restating, we have Bilbo a Thief who goes to Smaug&amp;rsquo;s Lair. He finds M treasures. Each treasure has some Weight and some Gold value. But Bilbo cannot really take all of that. He could only carry a certain Maximum Weight. But being a smart hobbit, he wants to Maximize the value of the treasures he takes. Given the values for weights and value of the treasures and the maximum weight that Bilbo could carry, could you find a good solution?
So in this problem we have an $1$x$M$ array of Weight Values W, Gold Values G and a value for the maximum weight $w_{MAX}$ that Bilbo can carry. We want to find out an $1$x$M$ array $X$ of 1&amp;rsquo;s and 0&amp;rsquo;s, which holds weather Bilbo Carries a particular treasure or not. This array needs to follow the constraint $WX^T &amp;lt; w_{MAX}$ and we want to maximize $GX^T$ for a particular state X.(Here the T means transpose)
So lets first discuss as to how we will create a proposal from a previous state.
 Pick a random index from the state and toggle the index value. Check if we satisfy our constraint. If yes this state is the proposal state. Else pick up another random index and repeat.  We also need to think about the Scoring Function. We need to give high values to states with high gold value. We will use: $$Score(X)=e^{\beta GX^T}$$ We give exponentially more value to higher score. The Beta here is a &#43;ve constant. But how to choose it? If $\beta$ is big we will give very high score to good solutions and the chain will not be able to try new solutions as it can get stuck in local optimas. If we give a small value the chain will not converge to very good solutions. So weuse an Optimization Technique called Simulated Annealing i.e. we will start with a small value of $\beta$ and increase as no of iterations go up. That way the chain will explore in the starting stages and stay at the best solution in the later stages.
So now we have everything we need to get started
import numpy as np W = [20,40,60,12,34,45,67,33,23,12,34,56,23,56] G = [120,420,610,112,341,435,657,363,273,812,534,356,223,516] W_max = 150 # This function takes a state X , The gold vector G and a Beta Value and return the Log of score def score_state_log(X,G,Beta): return Beta*np.dot(X,G) # This function takes as input a state X and the number of treasures M, The weight vector W and the maximum weight W_max # and returns a proposal state def create_proposal(X,W,W_max): M = len(W) random_index = random.randint(0,M-1) #print random_index proposal = list(X) proposal[random_index] = 1 - proposal[random_index] #Toggle #print proposal if np.dot(proposal,W)&amp;lt;=W_max: return proposal else: return create_proposal(X,W,W_max) # Takes as input a text to decrypt and runs a MCMC algorithm for n_iter.

max_state_value =0 Solution_MCMC = [0] for i in range(10): state_keeper,best_state = MCMC_Golddigger(50000,W,G,W_max,0.0005, .0005) state_value=np.dot(best_state,G) if state_value&amp;gt;max_state_value: max_state_value = state_value Solution_MCMC = best_state print &amp;#34;MCMC Solution is :&amp;#34; , str(Solution_MCMC) , &amp;#34;with Gold Value:&amp;#34;, str(max_state_value) MCMC Solution is : [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] with Gold Value: 2435  Now I won&amp;rsquo;t say that this is the best solution. The deterministic solution using DP will be the best for such use case but sometimes when the problems gets large, having such techniques at disposal becomes invaluable.
So tell me What do you think about MCMC Methods?
Also, If you find any good applications or would like to apply these techniques to some area, I would really be glad to know about them and help if possible.

        <![CDATA[  The things that I find hard to understand push me to my limits. One of the things that I have always found hard is Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods. When I first encountered them, I read a lot about them but mostly it ended like this.
  The meaning is normally hidden in deep layers of Mathematical noise and not easy to decipher. This blog post is intended to clear up the confusion around MCMC methods, Know what they are actually useful for and Get hands on with some applications.
So what really are MCMC Methods? First of all we have to understand what are Monte Carlo Methods!!!
Monte Carlo methods derive their name from Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco. There are many card games that need probability of winning against the dealer. Sometimes calculating this probability can be mathematically complex or highly intractable. But we can always run a computer simulation to simulate the whole game many times and see the probability as the number of wins divided by the number of games played.
So that is all you need to know about Monte carlo Methods. Yes it is just a simple simulation technique with a Fancy Name.
So as we have got the first part of MCMC, we also need to understand what are Markov Chains. Before Jumping onto Markov Chains let us learn a little bit about Markov Property.
Suppose you have a system of $M$ possible states, and you are hopping from one state to another. Markov Property says that given a process which is at a state $X_n$ at a particular point of time, the probability of $X_{n&#43;1} = k$, where $k$ is any of the $M$ states the process can hop to, will only be dependent on which state it is at the given moment of time. And not on how it reached the current state.
Mathematically speaking:
 $$P(X_{n&#43;1}=k | X_n=k_n,X_{n-1}=k_{n-1},....,X_1=k_1) = P(X_{n&#43;1}=k|X_n=k_n)$$ If a process exhibits the Markov Property than it is known as a Markov Process.
Now Why is a Markov Chain important? It is important because of its stationary distribution.
So what is a Stationary Distribution?
Assume you have a markov process like below. You start from any state $X_i$ and want to find out the state Probability distribution at $X_{i&#43;1}$.
  You have a matrix of transition probability  
which defines the probability of going from a state $X_i$ to $X_j$. You start calculating the Probability distribution for the next state. If you are at Bull Market State at time $i$ , you have a state Probability distribution as [0,1,0]
you want to get the state pdf at $X_{i&#43;1}$. That is given by
$$s_{i&#43;1} = s_{i}Q$$ $$ s_{i&#43;1}=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc} .15 &amp; .8 &amp; .05 \end{array} } \right]$$ And the next state distribution could be found out by $$s_{i&#43;1} = s_iQ^2$$div and so on. Eventually you will reach a stationary state s where: $$sQ=s$$ For this transition matrix Q the Stationary distribution $s$ is $$ s_{i&#43;1}=\left[ {\begin{array}{cc} .625 &amp; .3125 &amp; .0625 \end{array} } \right]$$ The stationary state distribution is important because it lets you define the probability for every state of a system at a random time. That is for this particular example we can say that 62.5% of the times market will be in a bull market state, 31.25% of weeks it will be a bear market and 6.25% of weeks it will be stagnant
Intuitively you can think of it as an random walk on a chain. You might visit some nodes more often than others based on node probabilities. In the Google Pagerank problem you might think of a node as a page, and the probability of a page in the stationary distribution as its relative importance.
Woah! That was a lot of information and we have yet not started talking about the MCMC Methods. Well if you are with me till now, we can now get on to the real topic now.
So What is MCMC? According to Wikipedia:
 **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** (MCMC) methods are a class of algorithms for **sampling from a probability distribution** based on constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its stationary distribution. The state of the chain after a number of steps is then used as a sample of the desired distribution. The quality of the sample improves as a function of the number of steps.  So let&amp;rsquo;s explain this with an example: Assume that we want to sample from a Beta distribution. The PDF is:
$$f(x) = Cx^{\alpha -1}(1-x)^{\beta -1}$$ where $C$ is the normalizing constant (which we actually don&amp;rsquo;t need to Sample from the distribution as we will see later).
This is a fairly difficult problem with the Beta Distribution if not intractable. In reality you might need to work with a lot harder Distribution Functions and sometimes you won&amp;rsquo;t actually know the normalizing constants.
MCMC methods make life easier for us by providing us with algorithms that could create a Markov Chain which has the Beta distribution as its stationary distribution given that we can sample from a uniform distribution(which is fairly easy).
If we start from a random state and traverse to the next state based on some algorithm repeatedly, we will end up creating a Markov Chain which has the Beta distribution as its stationary distribution and the states we are at after a long time could be used as sample from the Beta Distribution.
One such MCMC Algorithm is the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm
Metropolis Hastings Algorithm Let $s=(s_1,s_2,&amp;hellip;.,s_M)$ be the desired stationary distribution. We want to create a Markov Chain that has this stationary distribution. We start with an arbitrary Markov Chain $P$ with $M$ states with transition matrix $Q$, so that $Q_{ij}$ represents the probability of going from state $i$ to $j$. Intuitively we know how to wander around this Markov Chain but this Markov Chain does not have the required Stationary Distribution. This chain does have some stationary distribution(which is not of our use)
Our Goal is to change the way we wander on the this Markov Chain $P$ so that this chain has the desired Stationary distribution.
To do this we:
 Start at a random initial State $i$. Randomly pick a new Proposal State by looking at the transition probabilities in the ith row of the transition matrix Q. Compute an measure called the Acceptance Probability which is defined as: $a_{ij} = min(s_jp_{ji}/s_{i}p_{ij},1)$ Now Flip a coin that lands head with probability $a_{ij}$. If the coin comes up heads, accept the proposal i.e move to next state else reject the proposal i.e. stay at the current state. Repeat for a long time  After a long time this chain will converge and will have a stationary distribution $s$. We can then use the states of the chain as the sample from any distribution.
While doing this to sample the Beta Distribution, the only time we are using the PDF is to find the acceptance probability and in that we divide $s_j$ by $s_i$, i.e. the normalizing constant $C$ gets cancelled.
Now Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk about the intuition. For the Intuition I am quoting an Answer from the site Stack Exchange,as this was the best intuitive explanation that I could find:  I think there&amp;rsquo;s a nice and simple intuition to be gained from the (independence-chain) Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. First, what&amp;rsquo;s the goal? The goal of MCMC is to draw samples from some probability distribution without having to know its exact height at any point(We don&amp;rsquo;t need to know C). The way MCMC achieves this is to &amp;ldquo;wander around&amp;rdquo; on that distribution in such a way that the amount of time spent in each location is proportional to the height of the distribution. If the &amp;ldquo;wandering around&amp;rdquo; process is set up correctly, you can make sure that this proportionality (between time spent and height of the distribution) is achieved. Intuitively, what we want to do is to to walk around on some (lumpy) surface in such a way that the amount of time we spend (or # samples drawn) in each location is proportional to the height of the surface at that location. So, e.g., we&amp;rsquo;d like to spend twice as much time on a hilltop that&amp;rsquo;s at an altitude of 100m as we do on a nearby hill that&amp;rsquo;s at an altitude of 50m. The nice thing is that we can do this even if we don&amp;rsquo;t know the absolute heights of points on the surface: all we have to know are the relative heights. e.g., if one hilltop A is twice as high as hilltop B, then we&amp;rsquo;d like to spend twice as much time at A as we spend at B. The simplest variant of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (independence chain sampling) achieves this as follows: assume that in every (discrete) time-step, we pick a random new &amp;ldquo;proposed&amp;rdquo; location (selected uniformly across the entire surface). If the proposed location is higher than where we&amp;rsquo;re standing now, move to it. If the proposed location is lower, then move to the new location with probability p, where p is the ratio of the height of that point to the height of the current location. (i.e., flip a coin with a probability p of getting heads; if it comes up heads, move to the new location; if it comes up tails, stay where we are). Keep a list of the locations you&amp;rsquo;ve been at on every time step, and that list will (asyptotically) have the right proportion of time spent in each part of the surface. (And for the A and B hills described above, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with twice the probability of moving from B to A as you have of moving from A to B). There are more complicated schemes for proposing new locations and the rules for accepting them, but the basic idea is still: (1) pick a new &amp;ldquo;proposed&amp;rdquo; location; (2) figure out how much higher or lower that location is compared to your current location; (3) probabilistically stay put or move to that location in a way that respects the overall goal of spending time proportional to height of the location. 
Sampling from Beta Distribution Now Let&amp;rsquo;s Move on to the problem of Simulating from Beta Distribution. Now Beta Distribution is a continuous Distribution on [0,1] and it can have infinite states on [0,1].
Lets Assume an arbitrary Markov Chain P with infinite states on [0,1] having transition Matrix Q such that $Q_{ij} = Q_{ji} = $ All entries in Matrix. We don&amp;rsquo;t really need the Matrix Q as we will see later, But I want to keep the problem description as close to the algorihm we suggested.
 Start at a random initial State $i$ given by Unif(0,1). Randomly pick a new Proposal State by looking at the transition probabilities in the ith row of the transition matrix Q. Lets say we pick up another Unif(0,1) state as a proposal state $j$. Compute an measure called the Acceptance Probability :  $$a_{ij} = min(s_jp_{ji}/s_{i}p_{ij},1)$$ which is, $$a_{ij} = min(s_j/s_i,1)$$ where, $$s_i = Ci^{\alpha -1}(1-i)^{\beta -1}$$ and, $$s_j = Cj^{\alpha -1}(1-j)^{\beta -1}$$  Now Flip a coin that lands head with probability $a_{ij}$. If the coin comes up heads, accept the proposal i.e move to next state else reject the proposal i.e. stay at the current state. Repeat for a long time  So enough with theory, Let&amp;rsquo;s Move on to python to create our Beta Simulations Now&amp;hellip;.
import random # Lets define our Beta Function to generate s for any particular state. We don&amp;#39;t care for the normalizing constant here. def beta_s(w,a,b): return w**(a-1)*(1-w)**(b-1) # This Function returns True if the coin with probability P of heads comes heads when flipped. def random_coin(p): unif = random.uniform(0,1) if unif&amp;gt;=p: return False else: return True # This Function runs the MCMC chain for Beta Distribution. def beta_mcmc(N_hops,a,b): states = [] cur = random.uniform(0,1) for i in range(0,N_hops): states.append(cur) next = random.uniform(0,1) ap = min(beta_s(next,a,b)/beta_s(cur,a,b),1) # Calculate the acceptance probability if random_coin(ap): cur = next return states[-1000:] # Returns the last 100 states of the chain Let us check our results of the MCMC Sampled Beta distribution against the actual beta distribution.
import numpy as np import pylab as pl import scipy.special as ss %matplotlib inline pl.rcParams[&amp;#39;figure.figsize&amp;#39;] = (17.0, 4.0) # Actual Beta PDF. def beta(a, b, i): e1 = ss.gamma(a &#43; b) e2 = ss.gamma(a) e3 = ss.gamma(b) e4 = i ** (a - 1) e5 = (1 - i) ** (b - 1) return (e1/(e2*e3)) * e4 * e5 # Create a function to plot Actual Beta PDF with the Beta Sampled from MCMC Chain. def plot_beta(a, b): Ly = [] Lx = [] i_list = np.mgrid[0:1:100j] for i in i_list: Lx.append(i) Ly.append(beta(a, b, i)) pl.plot(Lx, Ly, label=&amp;#34;Real Distribution: a=&amp;#34;&#43;str(a)&#43;&amp;#34;, b=&amp;#34;&#43;str(b)) pl.hist(beta_mcmc(100000,a,b),normed=True,bins =25, histtype=&amp;#39;step&amp;#39;,label=&amp;#34;Simulated_MCMC: a=&amp;#34;&#43;str(a)&#43;&amp;#34;, b=&amp;#34;&#43;str(b)) pl.legend() pl.show() plot_beta(0.1, 0.1) plot_beta(1, 1) plot_beta(2, 3)  As we can see our sampled beta values closely resemble the beta distribution.
So MCMC Methods are useful for the following basic problems.
 Simulating from a Random Variable PDF. Example: Simulate from a Beta(0.5,0.5) or from a Normal(0,1). Solve problems with a large state space.For Example: Knapsack Problem, Encrytion Cipher etc. We will work on this in the Next Blog Post as this one has already gotten bigger than what I expected.  Till Then Ciao!!!!!!

        <![CDATA[  I have been using Hadoop a lot now a days and thought about writing some of the novel techniques that a user could use to get the most out of the Hadoop Ecosystem.
Using Shell Scripts to run your Programs I am not a fan of large bash commands. The ones where you have to specify the whole path of the jar files and the such. You can effectively organize your workflow by using shell scripts. Now Shell scripts are not as formidable as they sound. We wont be doing programming perse using these shell scripts(Though they are pretty good at that too), we will just use them to store commands that we need to use sequentially.
Below is a sample of the shell script I use to run my Mapreduce Codes.
#!/bin/bash #Defining program variables IP=&amp;#34;/data/input&amp;#34; OP=&amp;#34;/data/output&amp;#34; HADOOP_JAR_PATH=&amp;#34;/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-0.20-mapreduce/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming-2.0.0-mr1-cdh4.5.0.jar&amp;#34; MAPPER=&amp;#34;test_m.py&amp;#34; REDUCER=&amp;#34;test_r.py&amp;#34; hadoop fs -rmr -skipTrash&amp;amp;nbsp;$OP hadoop jar&amp;amp;nbsp;$HADOOP_JAR_PATH \ -file&amp;amp;nbsp;$MAPPER -mapper &amp;#34;python test_m.py&amp;#34; \ -file&amp;amp;nbsp;$REDUCER -reducer &amp;#34;python test_r.py&amp;#34; \ -input&amp;amp;nbsp;$IP -output&amp;amp;nbsp;$OP I generally save them as test_s.sh and whenever i need to run them i simply type sh test_s.sh. This helps in three ways.  It helps me to store hadoop commands in a manageable way.   It is easy to run the mapreduce code using the shell script.   If the code fails, I do not have to manually delete the output directory 
  The simplification of anything is always sensational.  Gilbert K. Chesterton  Using Distributed Cache to provide mapper with a dictionary Often times it happens that you want that your Hadoop Mapreduce program is able to access some static file. This static file could be a dictionary, could be parameters for the program or could be anything. What distributed cache does is that it provides this file to all the mapper nodes so that you can use that file in any way across all your mappers. Now this concept although simple would help you to think about Mapreduce in a whole new light. Lets start with an example. Supppose you have to create a sample Mapreduce program that reads a big file containing the information about all the characters in Game of Thrones stored as &amp;rdquo;/data/characters/&amp;rdquo;:   Cust_ID User_Name House     1 Daenerys Targaryen Targaryen   2 Tyrion Lannister Lannister   3 Cersei Lannister Lannister  4 Robert Baratheon Baratheon  5 Robb Stark Stark    
But you dont want to use the dead characters in the file for the analysis you want to do. You want to count the number of living characters in Game of Thrones grouped by their House. (I know its easy!!!!!) One thing you could do is include an if statement in your Mapper Code which checks if the persons ID is 4 then exclude it from the mapper and such. But the problem is that you would have to do it again and again for the same analysis as characters die like flies when it comes to George RR Martin.(Also where is the fun in that) So you create a file which contains the Ids of all the dead characters at &amp;rdquo;/data/dead_characters.txt&amp;rdquo;:
  Died     4   5     Whenever you have to run the analysis you can just add to this file and you wont have to change anything in the code. Also sometimes this file would be long and you would not want to clutter your code with IDs and such.
So How Would we do it. Let&amp;rsquo;s go in a step by step way around this. We will create a shell script, a mapper script and a reducer script for this task.
1) Shell Script #!/bin/bash #Defining program variables DC=&amp;#34;/data/dead_characters.txt&amp;#34; IP=&amp;#34;/data/characters&amp;#34; OP=&amp;#34;/data/output&amp;#34; HADOOP_JAR_PATH=&amp;#34;/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-0.20-mapreduce/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming-2.0.0-mr1-cdh4.5.0.jar&amp;#34; MAPPER=&amp;#34;got_living_m.py&amp;#34; REDUCER=&amp;#34;got_living_r.py&amp;#34; hadoop jar&amp;amp;nbsp;$HADOOP_JAR_PATH \ -file&amp;amp;nbsp;$MAPPER -mapper &amp;#34;python got_living_m.py&amp;#34; \ -file&amp;amp;nbsp;$REDUCER -reducer &amp;#34;python got_living_r.py&amp;#34; \ -cacheFile&amp;amp;nbsp;$DC#ref \ -input&amp;amp;nbsp;$IP -output&amp;amp;nbsp;$OP Note how we use the &amp;rdquo;-cacheFile&amp;rdquo; option here. We have specified that we will refer to the file that has been provided in the Distributed cache as #ref.
Next is our Mapper Script.
2) Mapper Script import sys dead_ids = set() def read_cache(): for line in open(&amp;#39;ref&amp;#39;): id = line.strip() dead_ids.add(id) read_cache() for line in sys.stdin: rec = line.strip().split(&amp;#34;|&amp;#34;) # Split using Delimiter &amp;#34;|&amp;#34; id = rec[0] house = rec[2] if id not in dead_ids: print &amp;#34;%s\t%s&amp;#34; % (house,1) And our Reducer Script.
3) Reducer Script import sys current_key = None key = None count = 0 for line in sys.stdin: line = line.strip() rec = line.split(&amp;#39;\t&amp;#39;) key = rec[0]	value = int(rec[1]) if current_key == key: count &#43;= value else: if current_key: print &amp;#34;%s:%s&amp;#34; %(key,str(count))	current_key = key count = value if current_key == key: print &amp;#34;%s:%s&amp;#34; %(key,str(count))	 This was a simple program and the output will be just what you expected and not very exciting. But the Technique itself solves a variety of common problems. You can use it to pass any big dictionary to your Mapreduce Program. Atleast thats what I use this feature mostly for. Hope You liked it. Will try to expand this post with more tricks.
The codes for this post are posted at github here.
Other Great Learning Resources For Hadoop:   Michael Noll&amp;rsquo;s Hadoop Mapreduce Tutorial   Apache&amp;rsquo;s Hadoop Streaming Documentation  
Also I like these books a lot. Must have for a Hadooper&amp;hellip;.
  The first book is a guide for using Hadoop as well as spark with Python. While the second one contains a detailed overview of all the things in Hadoop. Its the definitive guide.

Data Fields id: ad identifier click: 0/1 for non-click/click hour: format is YYMMDDHH, so 14091123 means 23:00 on Sept. 11, 2014 UTC. C1 -- anonymized categorical variable banner_pos site_id site_domain site_category app_id app_domain app_category device_id device_ip device_model device_type device_conn_type C14-C21 -- anonymized categorical variables  Loading Data ## Loading the data  import pandas as pd import numpy as np import string as stri #too large data not keeping it in memory. # will be using line by line scripting. #data = pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;/Users/RahulAgarwal/kaggle_cpr/train&amp;#34;) Since the data is too large around 6 gb , we will proceed by doing line by line analysis of data. We will try to use vowpal wabbit first of all as it is an online model and it also gives us the option of minimizing log loss as a default. It is also very fast to run and will give us quite an intuition as to how good our prediction can be.
I will use all the variables in the first implementation and we will rediscover things as we move on
Running Vowpal Wabbit Creating data in vowpal format (One Time Only) from datetime import datetime def csv_to_vw(loc_csv, loc_output, train=True): start = datetime.now() print(&amp;#34;\nTurning %sinto %s. Is_train_set? %s&amp;#34;%(loc_csv,loc_output,train)) i = open(loc_csv, &amp;#34;r&amp;#34;) j = open(loc_output, &amp;#39;wb&amp;#39;) counter=0 with i as infile: line_count=0 for line in infile: # to counter the header if line_count==0: line_count=1 continue # The data has all categorical features #numerical_features = &amp;#34;&amp;#34; categorical_features = &amp;#34;&amp;#34; counter = counter&#43;1 #print counter line = line.split(&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;) if train: #working on the date column. We will take day , hour a = line[2] new_date= datetime(int(&amp;#34;20&amp;#34;&#43;a[0:2]),int(a[2:4]),int(a[4:6])) day = new_date.strftime(&amp;#34;%A&amp;#34;) hour= a[6:8] categorical_features &#43;= &amp;#34; |hr %s&amp;#34; % hour categorical_features &#43;= &amp;#34; |day %s&amp;#34; % day # 24 columns in data  for i in range(3,24): if line[i] != &amp;#34;&amp;#34;: categorical_features &#43;= &amp;#34;|c%s%s&amp;#34; % (str(i),line[i]) else: a = line[1] new_date= datetime(int(&amp;#34;20&amp;#34;&#43;a[0:2]),int(a[2:4]),int(a[4:6])) day = new_date.strftime(&amp;#34;%A&amp;#34;) hour= a[6:8] categorical_features &#43;= &amp;#34; |hr %s&amp;#34; % hour categorical_features &#43;= &amp;#34; |day %s&amp;#34; % day for i in range(2,23): if line[i] != &amp;#34;&amp;#34;: categorical_features &#43;= &amp;#34; |c%s%s&amp;#34; % (str(i&#43;1),line[i]) #Creating the labels #print &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; if train: #we care about labels if line[1] == &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;: label = 1 else: label = -1 #we set negative label to -1 #print (numerical_features) #print categorical_features j.write( &amp;#34;%s&amp;#39;%s%s\n&amp;#34; % (label,line[0],categorical_features)) else: #we dont care about labels #print ( &amp;#34;1 &amp;#39;%s |i%s |c%s\n&amp;#34; % (line[0],numerical_features,categorical_features) ) j.write( &amp;#34;1 &amp;#39;%s%s\n&amp;#34; % (line[0],categorical_features) ) #Reporting progress #print counter if counter % 1000000 == 0: print(&amp;#34;%s\t%s&amp;#34;%(counter, str(datetime.now() - start))) print(&amp;#34;\n%sTask execution time:\n\t%s&amp;#34;%(counter, str(datetime.now() - start))) #csv_to_vw(&amp;#34;/Users/RahulAgarwal/kaggle_cpr/train&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;/Users/RahulAgarwal/kaggle_cpr/click.train_original_data.vw&amp;#34;,train=True) #csv_to_vw(&amp;#34;/Users/RahulAgarwal/kaggle_cpr/test&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;/Users/RahulAgarwal/kaggle_cpr/click.test_original_data.vw&amp;#34;,train=False) Running Vowpal Wabbit on the data The Vowpal Wabbit will be run on the command line itself.
Training VW:
vw click.train_original_data.vw -f click.model.vw --loss_function logistic Testing VW:
vw click.test_original_data.vw -t -i click.model.vw -p click.preds.txt Creating Kaggle Submission File import math def zygmoid(x): return 1 / (1 &#43; math.exp(-x)) with open(&amp;#34;kaggle.click.submission.csv&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;wb&amp;#34;) as outfile: outfile.write(&amp;#34;id,click\n&amp;#34;) for line in open(&amp;#34;click.preds.txt&amp;#34;): row = line.strip().split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;) try: outfile.write(&amp;#34;%s,%f\n&amp;#34;%(row[1],zygmoid(float(row[0])))) except: pass This solution ranked 211&amp;frasl;371 submissions at the time and the leaderboard score was 0.4031825 while the best leaderboard score was 0.3901120
Next Steps  Create a better VW model
 Shuffle the data before making the model as the VW algorithm is an online learner and might have given more preference to the latest data provide high weights for clicks as data is skewed. How Much? tune VW algorithm using vw-hypersearch. What should be tuned? Use categorical features like |C1 &amp;ldquo;C1&amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;&amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo;  Create a XGBoost Model.
 Create a Sofia-ML Model and see how it works on this data.
