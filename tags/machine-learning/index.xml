Unfortunately, many data scientists often just end up seeing the ROC curves and then quoting an AUC (short for the area under the ROC curve) value without really understanding what the AUC value means and how they can use them more effectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I cracked my MLE interview at Facebook</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/10/30/mle-fb-interview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/10/30/mle-fb-interview/</guid><description>&lt;p>It was August last year and I was in the process of giving interviews.
