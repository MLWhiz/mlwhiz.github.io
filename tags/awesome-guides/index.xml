And, I really wanted to have something like the Iris Dataset for Instance Segmentation so that I would be able to explain the model without worrying about the dataset too much. But, alas, it is not always possible to get a dataset that you are looking for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Create an Awesome Development Setup for Data Science using Atom</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/09/02/atom_for_data_science/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/09/02/atom_for_data_science/</guid><description>&lt;p>Before I even begin this article, let me just say that I love iPython Notebooks, and Atom is not an alternative to Jupyter in any way.

&lt;p>Recently I started up with a competition on kaggle on text classification, and as a part of the competition, I had to somehow move to Pytorch to get deterministic results. Now I have always worked with Keras in the past and it has given me pretty good results, but somehow I got to know that the &lt;strong>CuDNNGRU/CuDNNLSTM layers in keras are not deterministic&lt;/strong>, even after setting the seeds. So Pytorch did come to rescue. And am I glad that I moved.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shell Basics every Data Scientist Should know - Part II(AWK)</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2015/10/11/shell_basics_for_data_science_2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2015/10/11/shell_basics_for_data_science_2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday I got introduced to awk programming on the shell and is it cool.
