For context, the first three versions of YOLO (You Only Look Once) were created by Joseph Redmon. Following this, Alexey Bochkovskiy created YOLOv4 on darknet, which boasted higher Average Precision (AP) and faster results than previous iterations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Implementing Object Detection and Instance Segmentation for Data Scientists</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/12/06/weapons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/12/06/weapons/</guid><description>&lt;p>Object Detection is a helpful tool to have in your coding repository.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Demystifying Object Detection and Instance Segmentation for Data Scientists</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/12/05/od/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/12/05/od/</guid><description>&lt;p>I like deep learning a lot but Object Detection is something that doesnâ€™t come easily to me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Object Detection: An End to End Theoretical Perspective</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2018/09/22/object_detection/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2018/09/22/object_detection/</guid><description>&lt;p>We all know about the image classification problem.
