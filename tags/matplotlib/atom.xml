      <description>Visualizations are awesome. However, a good visualization is annoyingly hard to make.
Moreover, it takes time and effort when it comes to present these visualizations to a bigger audience.
We all know how to make Bar-Plots, Scatter Plots, and Histograms, yet we don&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention to beautify them.
This hurts us - our credibility with peers and managers. You won&amp;rsquo;t feel it now, but it happens.</description>

      <description>When it comes to data preparation and getting acquainted with data, the one step we normally skip is the data visualization. While a part of it could be attributed to the lack of good visualization tools for the platforms we use, most of us also get lazy at times.
Now as we know of it Python never had any good Visualization library. For most of our plotting needs, I would read up blogs, hack up with StackOverflow solutions and haggle with Matplotlib documentation each and every time I needed to make a simple graph.</description>
