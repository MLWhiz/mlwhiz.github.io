        <![CDATA[  Collecting and analysing data, including but not limited to text, images, and video formats, is a huge part of various industries. It can be an incredibly complex process to sift through massive amounts of data and leverage it to benefit your business by discovering key patterns. Many people who begin learning data science or are considering taking it up are often employed in other industries, to begin with. They may be afraid that pursuing this new area will leave them high and dry with few prospects, and considering how taking up data science requires a good background of Probability and Statistics, they may not think it&amp;rsquo;s worth the effort. However, many industries benefit from the expertise of data scientists, such as those on the following list below:
1. The Transportation Industry In India, Analytics India Mag reports that the Delhi government is planning to invest in a new traffic management system using radar-based monitoring with the help of AI. For example, the Allahabad police are using this new technology to direct traffic at the Kumbh Mela, one of the world’s largest religious gatherings. India’s Railway minister Piyush Goyal adds, “AI can transform Indian Railways in terms of safety, passenger amenities, better revenues, growth and efficiency.” Railway Age describes how data science leads to vital insights into the degradation of track and equipment components, identifying areas of potential failure for improvement and repair. Due to recent developments in technology, “railroads are starting to look at the predictive analytics tools within this field of Data Science to help optimise and plan maintenance and improve safety,” while providing new and actionable insights.
2. The Legal Industry Although Forbes claims that the legal sector is slow to adopt big data, currently lagging behind other industries, they also claim that “in the digital age, legal providers that fail to make this investment will be unable to compete with those that do.” Special Counsel’s data analysis page explains that the right methods can make all the difference for law firms, as these enable them to better manage information, make effective decisions, and mitigate risks. For one, database administration can help optimise database performance through automated monitoring systems that provide streamlined projects from start to finish. Data engineering and warehousing can also centralise data from law enterprises hosted across multiple sites while simultaneously analysing a large quantity of information. Also, if a law firm is struggling with a database containing duplicate amounts of information along with out-dated data, analytics can help organise these documents by theme and eliminate any unnecessary information.
3. The Healthcare Industry Research published by the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association suggests that the demand for data scientists in the healthcare sector is growing incredibly swiftly. Through the methods of pattern recognition, statistical analysis, and deep learning algorithms, data science is revolutionising the healthcare industry. The invaluable ability to process massive amounts of data related to laboratory results, as well as clinical reports, leads to a quicker and more efficient diagnostic service. AI in healthcare is being urged by India&amp;rsquo;s Niti Aayog, who states that &amp;ldquo;by taking advantage of AI, India could grow its gross domestic product by 1.3 percentage points annually to US$957 billion by 2035.&amp;rdquo; In addition, Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan adds that “the potential of AI in public health is being explored in our country,&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare working towards using AI in a safe and effective way in public health in India.”
To sum it all up, data science provides invaluable benefits across a wide range of industries. In this day and age, collecting data is ultimately useless if you can’t utilise it in an efficient manner. Data science organises this data and provides real-world applications that impact customers in meaningful ways.

        <![CDATA[  Technological developments have paved the way for new niche industries, where professions like data science have appeared.
Data scientists have the knowledge and expertise to perform the work that data analysts do, and then some. They analyze and interpret complex data sets of varying structures, and are able to solve obscure problems with codes, models, and machine-learning algorithms.
As you can see in our post ‘How did I Learn Data Science?’, there are many steps to be taken if you want to be a specialist in the field.
From learning the basics of probability and statistics, to learning Data Science in Python to create your own work, Machine Learning, Spark, Linux Shell, Inferential Statistics, NLP, and algorithms––aspiring data scientists must train themselves, whether through online programs and tutorials or through local classes with established mentors.
The language of data science is universal, and the field is gaining traction across the globe. Information Week notes there has been an 8% increase in data science job searches from 2017 to 2019, and actual job postings grew by 55%. A lot of professionals spend years learning their trade, and many of them even have master’s degrees, at the very least.
However, Citizen Data Scientists have emerged as well. These people incorporate their own expertise and unique abilities to analytics tasks, as their primary job function is external to the field of analytics. They are said to serve complementary roles to traditional data scientists.
When collaboration between the two occurs, skills diversify and consolidated knowledge is used for analyses that have been successful. Currently, there are over 2 million students studying the data science courses on learning platform Udemy, with the beginner courses being taken nearly 100,000 times. Nowadays, learning is made possible anywhere. Data science is clearly a booming industry, with many countries having taken a huge interest in the field as businesses continue to expand.
Now is the time for data scientists to shine. And here are some of the top cities for them to thrive in:
1. Bengaluru, India India is projected to have the biggest world economy as an area often targeted for outsourcing––including tech.
Bengaluru has been dubbed the Silicon Valley of India, as it has the best analytics market in the country.
Foreign tech firms have likewise been hosted in this city. It’s become a hub for technological advancements, AI labs, and both tech startups and giants who have contributed significantly to the growing sector. People have flocked to Bengaluru because of its cost of living as well, making it even more ideal for graduates just starting out.
2. Dublin, Ireland As Europe’s newest cloud gateway, it houses server farms for big names like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook. This is what draws the cream of the crop in terms of data scientists to Dublin. The average income of the top data scientists in the country is roughly $100,000, which is three times the average salary in Ireland. Despite these facts, the National Analytics Maturity Study found that companies are struggling to find competent people to fill in data science and analysis jobs. This dilemma may continue to increase as more companies incorporate data-related jobs in the coming years. Now may be the best time to consider Dublin, if you need a bit of a change.
3. Lexington Park, Maryland, The United States Lexington Park hosts a high number of tech jobs, with almost a fourth of the city being employed in the STEM field. Therefore, it has the highest median STEM wage in the entire country, with most employees earning six figures.
Over 2,500 data science jobs are found in the city, and the area has more data science jobs per thousand, in contrast to any other place in the US.
4. London, United Kingdom London is known as the world’s hub for AI and FinTech. The UK government is highly invested in this field and has participated in a £1 billion deal together with 50 tech-involved businesses worldwide. While in part this comes from its dwindling economy and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit deal, it continues to offer some of the highest paying and most reputable jobs in the field. They often host events related to the industry, such as the Deep Learning Summit, Strata Data Conference, and ODSC’s European Conference. It also houses the Alan Turing Institute-the national institute of data science and AI.
5. Singapore, Singapore Standing at number 6 in the list of the world’s Smart Cities, Singapore has seen all kinds of developments in self-driving vehicles, AI, and IT. Like the UK, it receives strong government backing in the form of investments for city infrastructure, which makes use of advanced technology. Many tech startups, giants, and VCs have viewed the city as the place to be in Southeast Asia.

        <![CDATA[  It is election month in India and a quote by Dr. Rahat Indori sums it up pretty well.
 “सरहदों पर बहुत तनाव है क्या , पता तो करो चुनाव है क्या !”  For English speakers, this means: Is there a lot of tension at the borders? just ask if the elections are on.
This election India has talked about a lot of issues. News channels have talked about Patriotism, Socialism, Religion as well as terrorism.
You might have heard of the tension brewing between India and Pakistan.
This election season has also been marred with a cacophony of insults. Politicians seem to have forgotten basic manners.
Calling the Prime Minister a Chai-Wala(Tea-Seller) and a Chowkidaar(Watchman). And the Prime Minister accepting both titles with grace and putting a Chowkidaar in front of his name on Twitter too. It was pure genius.
Today is the final phase of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. I urge all those voting in this phase to vote in record numbers. Your one vote will shape India’s development trajectory in the years to come. I also hope first time voters vote enthusiastically.
&amp;mdash; Chowkidar Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 19, 2019 
Now finally the elections are over and the news channels are releasing the exit polls. This is pretty good data to look at.
And why waste good data?
So, here is an effort to showing some of the election data using some interactive visualizations using Flourish.
Recap of Politics in India To give a little perspective, in India, the center is held by BJP(Bhartiya Janta Party) and Narendra Modi is the current prime minister of India.
Most of India’s political history has been dominated by INC(Indian National Congress). This is the party of Mahatma Gandhi. INC’s head Rahul Gandhi, who is sometimes called the 50 years old youth, could be the perfect example of dynastic politics.
There are a lot of other local state parties, which I will call as OTH(Others)
For a perspective to the US audience(very broadly): BJP=Right Wing and INC=Left Wing.
India has 28 states and each state has a number of electoral seats. This is the seat distribution as per states.

Let us talk a little about the swing states.
The first state is Uttar Pradesh. A region of caste-based politics. Holding 8o seats out of 543 seats. A state that could swing the whole election. This state is the home of a large coalition named “MahaGatbandhan”(Literally a large coalition). This coalition is created by two heavy-weights — Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati. Both have totally opposite views, yet they came together to move the BJP government out of the center.
Then there is the case of West Bengal having 42 seats, which is held by Mamata Banerjee. Sometimes people say that it might be a dictatorship and there have been a lot of violent incidents in this state over the past few days.She might also form a coalition with INC in the later stage to overthrow the current government.
All in all, INC, MahaGatbandhan and all others are out there to overthrow BJP(Modi government)
Exit Polls Now the elections are over after 7 phases of voting. And today is the exit polls in India.
That means all the news channels will come up with their individual surveys across the 542 Loksabha seats across the 28 states.
Let us not wait further and look at exit poll data of various news channels.
Here it is:

Seems like a sweeping victory for BJP and alliance.
And here is a racing bar chart of the same.

The only thing that doesn’t seem to move is BJP&#43; and seems like there will be a second term based on this visualization.

The parliament seems to look a little bit orange(BJP Color)though not as much as the last time.
And the swing states. I am going to look at poll data by TimesNow.

While it seems like a defeat for BJP&#43; in West Bengal, more than 10 seats in WB is actually a lot as per the state politics of left and should be categorized as a win.
In Uttar Pradesh too, BJP&#43; was able to handle a great opposition in form of Mahagatbandhan and that seems a win too.
Conclusion The 2019 Mandate seems to be favoring BJP and its allies.
And it is a sweeping answer to people who promote caste-based politics, dynastic rules, and minority appeasement politics.
Here is a tweet showing some frustration by the current CM of West Bengal.
I don’t trust Exit Poll gossip. The game plan is to manipulate or replace thousands of EVMs through this gossip. I appeal to all Opposition parties to be united, strong and bold. We will fight this battle together
&amp;mdash; Mamata Banerjee (@MamataOfficial) May 19, 2019 
While the data seems to show a lot of promise for BJP&#43;, we still need to see if the predictions by these news channels stand up to the actuals. The Election results will be published by 23 May.
I would also like to highlight Flourish here, which made creating the visualizations a breeze.
Visualizations that were Easy to make, Publish and share.
If you want to learn about best strategies for creating Visualizations, I would like to call out an excellent course about Data Visualization and applied plotting from the University of Michigan which is a part of a pretty good Data Science Specialization with Python in itself. Do check it out
I am going to be writing more visualization posts in the future too. Follow me up at Medium or Subscribe to my blog.
PS: I am a BJP Supporter but I have tried to be as objective as possible.

        <![CDATA[  This is a post which deviates from my pattern fo blogs that I have wrote till now but I found that Finance also uses up a lot of Statistics. So it won&amp;rsquo;t be a far cry to put this on my blog here. I recently started investing in Mutual funds so thought of rersearching the area before going all in. Here is the result of some of my research.
1. Load/No-Load: Always Buy No Load Mutual Funds
2. Regular/Direct: There are many differenct sites from where you can buy Mutual funds. Most of these sites take a commision to let you the investor buy and sell from their platform. To overcome this commision you can buy direct Mutual funds from the fund houses themselves. But that would be difficult as their are a lot of fund houses and mmanaging all of that could be quite painful. But with the advent of MFUtility you can buy direct plans from the same platform.
3. Expense Ratios: The expense ratio is a measure of what it costs an investment company to operate a mutual fund. To see how expense ratios can affect your investments over time, let’s compare the returns of several hypothetical investments that differ only in expense ratio. The following table depicts the returns on a 10,000 initial investment, assuming an average annualized gain of 10%, with different expense ratios (0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2% and 2.5%):
  As the table illustrates, even a small difference in expense ratio can cost you a lot of money in the long run. If you had invested 10,000 in the fund with a 2.5% expense ratio, the value of your fund would be 46,022 after 20 years. Had you instead invested your 10,000 in the fund with a lower, 0.5% expense ratio, your investment would be worth $61,159 after two decades, a 0.33% improvement over the more expensive fund. Keep in mind, this hypothetical example examines funds whose only differences are the expense ratios: all other variables, including initial investment and annualized gains, remain constant (for the example, we must assume identical taxation as well). While two funds are not likely to have the exact same performance over a 20-year period, the table illustrates the effects that small changes in expense ratio can have on your long-term returns.
 4. Avoid Mutual Funds With High Turnover Ratios: Mutual fund turnover is calculated as the value of all transactions (buying, selling) divided by two, then divided by a fund&amp;rsquo;s total holdings. In simpler terms, mutual fund turnover typically measures the replacement of holdings in a mutual fund, and is commonly presented to investors as a percentage over a one year period. If a fund has 100% turnover, the fund replaces all of its holdings over a 12-month period and that bears cost to the investment company in terms of brokerage etc.
5. Look for Ample Diversification of Assets: Simply owning four different mutual funds specializing in the financial sector (shares of banks, insurance companies, etc.) is not diversification. Don’t own funds that make heavy sector or industry bets. If you choose to despite this warning, make sure that you don’t have a huge portion of your funds invested in them. If it’s a bond fund, you typically want to avoid bets on the direction of interest rates as this is rank speculation.
6. Not Same Fund Family: Don’t keep all of your funds within the same fund family. Witness the mutual fund scandal of a few years ago where portfolio management at many firms allowed big traders to market time the funds, essentially stealing money from smaller investors. By spreading your assets out at different companies, you can mitigate the risk of internal turmoil, ethics breaches, and other localized problems.
7. Keep Track of various Risk Ratios: a. Standard deviation: Standard deviation (SD) measures the volatility the fund&amp;rsquo;s returns in relation to its average. It tells you how much the fund&amp;rsquo;s return can deviate from the historical mean return of the scheme. If a fund has a 12% average rate of return and a standard deviation of 4%, its return will range from 8-16%
Computation:
Standard Deviation (SD) = Square root of Variance (V)
Variance = (Sum of squared difference between each monthly return and its mean / number of monthly return data – 1)
b. R-Squared: R-Squared measures the relationship between a portfolio and its benchmark. It can be thought of as a percentage from 1 to 100. R-squared is not a measure of the performance of a portfolio. A great portfolio can have a very low R-squared. It is simply a measure of the correlation of the portfolio&amp;rsquo;s returns to the benchmark&amp;rsquo;s returns.
Computation:
R-Squared = Square of Correlation
Correlation(xy)= Covariance between index and portfolio/(Standard deviation of portfolio * standard deviation of index)
Significance:
 If you want a portfolio that moves like the benchmark, you&amp;rsquo;d want a portfolio with a high Rsquared.
 If you want a portfolio that doesn&amp;rsquo;t move at all like the benchmark, you&amp;rsquo;d want a low R-squared.
  General Range for R-Squared:
 70-100% = good correlation between the portfolio&amp;rsquo;s returns and the benchmark&amp;rsquo;s returns
 40-70% = average correlation between the portfolio&amp;rsquo;s returns and the benchmark&amp;rsquo;s returns
 1-40% = low correlation between the portfolio&amp;rsquo;s returns and the benchmark&amp;rsquo;s returns
 Index funds will have an R-squared very close to 100.
 R-squared can be used to ascertain the significance of a particular beta or alpha. Generally, a higher R-squared will indicate a more useful beta figure. If the R-squared is lower, then the beta is less relevant to the fund&amp;rsquo;s performance
 Values range from 1 (returns are explained 100% by the market) to 0 (returns bear no association with the market)
  c. Beta: A beta of 1.0 indicates that the investment&amp;rsquo;s price will move in lock-step with the market.
A beta of less than 1.0 indicates that the investment will be less volatile than the market, and, correspondingly, a beta of more than 1.0 indicates that the investment&amp;rsquo;s price will be more volatile than the market.
For example, if a fund portfolio&amp;rsquo;s beta is 1.2, it&amp;rsquo;s theoretically 20% more volatile than the market. Conservative investors looking to preserve capital should focus on securities and fund portfolios with low betas, whereas those investors willing to take on more risk in search of higher returns should look for high beta investments.
Computation:
Beta = (Standard Deviation of Fund x R-Square) / Standard Deviation of Benchmark
If a fund has a beta of 1.5, it means that for every 10% upside or downside, the fund&amp;rsquo;s NAV would be 15% in the respective direction.
d. Jensens Alpha: Alpha is a measure of an investment&amp;rsquo;s performance on a risk-adjusted basis.
Simply stated, alpha is often considered to represent the value that a portfolio manager adds or subtracts from a fund portfolio&amp;rsquo;s return.
A positive alpha of 1.0 means the fund has outperformed its benchmark index by 1%. Correspondingly, a similar negative alpha would indicate an underperformance of 1%.
Computation:
Alpha = {(Fund return-Risk free return) – (Funds beta) *(Benchmark return- risk free return)}
For example, assume a mutual fund realized a return of 15% last year. The appropriate market index for this fund returned 12%. The beta of the fund versus that same index is 1.2 and the risk-free rate is 3%. The fund&amp;rsquo;s alpha is calculated as:
Alpha = {(15 -3) – (1.2) *(12- 3)} = 12 - 9 x 1.2 = 12-10.8 = 1.2
Given a beta of 1.2, the mutual fund is expected to be riskier than the index, and thus earn more. A positive alpha in this example shows that the mutual fund manager earned more than enough return to be compensated for the risk he took over the course of the year. If the mutual fund only returned 13%, the calculated alpha would be -0.8. With a negative alpha, the mutual fund manager would not have earned enough return given the amount of risk he was taking.
e. Sharpe Ratio: Sharpe Ratio measures how well the fund has performed vis-a vis the risk taken by it. It is the excess return over risk-free return (usually return from treasury bills or government securities) divided by the standard deviation. The higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better the fund has performed in proportion to the risk taken by it. The Sharpe ratio is also known as Reward-to-Variability ratio and it is named after William Forsyth Sharpe.
Computation:
SR = (Total Return – Risk Free Rate) / SD Of Fund
For example: Your investor gets 7 per cent return on her investment in a scheme with a standard deviation/volatility of 0.5. We assume risk free rate is 5 per cent. Sharpe Ratio is 7-5&amp;frasl;0.5 = 4 in this case
8. And Finally Always Dollar-Cost Average: Dollar cost averaging is a technique designed to reduce market risk through the systematic purchase of securities at predetermined intervals and set amounts.Instead of investing assets in a lump sum, the investor works his way into a position by slowly buying smaller amounts over a longer period of time. This spreads the cost basis out over several years, providing insulation against changes in market price.
Every investor investment strategy differs. These are just some common guidelines to work your way through the market and making informed decisions while buying Mutual Funds. Normally I work through points 1-6 and get my list to a few mutual funds after which I generally use risk ratios to determine which of the funds I selected might be a winner. I have a bias towards long term investing when it comes to investing so whatever I wrote here must be taken with a grain of salt just as everything related to investment must be. Some of you who are doing this for a longer time than I can also tell me about the various other things I can do. I will try to include those ideas in this post as well.
To Learn more about Mutual funds and investing in general, take a look at the following two gems:
  The Editorial review of The intelligent Investor says &amp;ldquo;Among the library of investment books promising no-fail strategies for riches, Benjamin Graham&amp;rsquo;s classic, The Intelligent Investor, offers no guarantees or gimmicks but overflows with the wisdom at the core of all good portfolio management&amp;rdquo; and it rings true in every sense. A must read for everyone looking to invest seriously.
Common Sense on Mutual Funds focusses on Mutual funds exclusively. Lets you understand that investing is not difficult. For the not so involved reader.
Till than Ciao!!!
