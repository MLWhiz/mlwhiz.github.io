      <description>It has been quite a few days I have been working with Pandas and apparently I feel I have gotten quite good at it. (Quite a Braggard I know) So thought about adding a post about Pandas usage here. I intend to make this post quite practical and since I find the pandas syntax quite self explanatory, I won&amp;rsquo;t be explaining much of the codes. Just the use cases and the code to achieve them.</description>
