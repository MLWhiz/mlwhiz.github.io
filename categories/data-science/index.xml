Unfortunately, many data scientists often just end up seeing the ROC curves and then quoting an AUC (short for the area under the ROC curve) value without really understanding what the AUC value means and how they can use them more effectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Do you know about the Magic Methods in Python?</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2021/02/03/dunder-methods-python/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2021/02/03/dunder-methods-python/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my last

And that’s mainly because it is not really explained in the right way in a lot of places. Normally a lot of books start by explaining OOP by talking about the three big terms — &lt;strong>Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism&lt;/strong>. But the time the book can explain these topics, anyone who is just starting would already feel lost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Use of Machine Learning in Predicting Sports Match Outcomes</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/10/22/sports-match-outcome-guest/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/10/22/sports-match-outcome-guest/</guid><description>&lt;p>Out of all spheres of technological advancement, artificial intelligence has always attracted the most attention from the general public.
