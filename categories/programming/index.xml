But the time the book can explain these topics, anyone who is just starting would already feel lost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Look like a 10x developer</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/11/13/look-like-a-developer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2020/11/13/look-like-a-developer/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love working with shell commands.
