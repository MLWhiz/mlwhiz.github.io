Computer Vision is the next Big Thing and something that is going to capture a large part of the next years so it makes a lot of sense to learn it. CV comprises of tasks such as Image Classification, Detection, Instance Segmentation etc.</description></item><item><title>Data Science</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/categories/data-science/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/categories/data-science/</guid><description>Data Science is an awesome culmination of Programming and Statistics. Right now, it encompasses Machine Learning and even Artificial intelligence. The most common problems in here to solve are Classification, Regression, Recommender Systems, Anomaly detection, etc.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/categories/deep-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/categories/deep-learning/</guid><description>Deep Learning is on everyoneâ€™s mind. Weather it be computer vision or Natural Language Processing both are powered by this awesome field.</description></item><item><title>Learning Resources</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/categories/learning-resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/categories/learning-resources/</guid><description>Learning is a great journey in itself. And a mighty hard one at that. So much to learn and so many paths to choose that it leaves us confused at times. I get many questions regarding how I learned myself? Or which books I find good? Here are my recommendations</description></item><item><title>Natural Language Processing</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/categories/natural-language-processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/categories/natural-language-processing/</guid><description>Natural Language Processing is a vastly inetersting field but it is inherently hard to learn because of its vastness. I myself had a tough time understanding just where to start. It comprises of tasks such as Sequence Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Translation, Text to Speech, Question Answering, Language Modeling, Summarization etc.</description></item><item><title>Programming</title><link>https://mlwhiz.com/categories/programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mlwhiz.com/categories/programming/</guid><description>Programming is the most fundamental skill of it all as in you need programming to be able to really do anything worth a mention. And that is why it is asked at a lot of technical interviews in form of Data Structures questions.</description></item></channel></rss>
